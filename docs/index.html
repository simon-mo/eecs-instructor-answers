            <h2 id="Should-people-interested-in-systems-take-189"><a href="#Should-people-interested-in-systems-take-189" class="headerlink" title="Should people interested in systems take 189?"></a>Should people interested in systems take 189?</h2><p>2017-10-25<br>99% of this piazza is people saying they’re interested in AI/ML.<br>But for us 0.00001 people who are more into systems/software (e.g. I’m in 162<br>right now and enjoy the class a lot, I also plan on doing 164 because<br>compilers are awesome, etc.), should we also take 189, given that ML seems to<br>be taking over all of CS?<br>I used to think ML was like a ‘weird’ area of CS that was more like Applied<br>Math/Statistics than ‘standard’ CS.<br>But looking at the systems research being done here: the 162 professor<br>(Stoica) does research in systems for… <em><strong>machine learning and big</strong><br><strong>data?!</strong></em> And the other professor who teaches 162, Joseph, does research in<br>security for … <em><strong>machine</strong> <strong>learning?!?!</strong></em> And of course in computer<br>architecture, you ‘ve got Google’s TPU for machine learning etc.<br>Clearly 189 would be important for systems people too, but I’m already a<br>junior and haven’t even taken the preparatory courses for 189: Math 53,<br>EE16A/B, EECS 126, 127 or Math 110. Should I still try to take those courses?</p>
<h3 id="Anant-Sahai’s-answer"><a href="#Anant-Sahai’s-answer" class="headerlink" title="Anant Sahai’s answer"></a>Anant Sahai’s answer</h3><p>I think that CS systems people are incredibly important. (And I say this as<br>someone who is not in CS systems.) From a distance, what is happening is that<br>CS systems is becoming exactly like what EE circuits has been like for a while<br>— the details of the algorithms and problems matter because there are<br>incredible synergies to the implementation and algorithms need to be changed<br>to be implementable. This means that a CS systems person needs to be educated<br>in the mold of a traditional EE circuits education — and that means getting<br>a healthy dose of mathy courses to go alongside a core set of CS systems<br>courses.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the lower-division core that everyone takes has already been<br>shifted in anticipation of this. All CS Systems students need to take Math 53,<br>EE16A, EE16B, and 70 along with 61A, 61B, and 61C. This goes without saying.<br>From there, it is about choosing courses that are both core as well some that<br>go deep into their area. Of course 162 is an amazing course that is core and<br>central to CS systems. A CS Systems student should take other 16X courses as<br>well for depth in systems. 149 is another core course for the emerging area of<br>CS systems in embedded systems — since being tied to servers and PCs is way<br>too limiting an education for the future.</p>
<p>But beyond that, a CS Systems student should take core courses elsewhere as<br>well. The core upper-div algorithms course is 170, and all CS systems students<br>should take that. The core upper-div ML course is 127, and I personally think<br>that all CS systems students should take that too (because it is the<br><em>optimization</em> part of ML that the systems person has to support in their<br>system design, as well as the <em>optimization</em> aspect of ML that a systems<br>person is going to be leveraging to make their systems work better.). The core<br>upper-div digital design course is 151, and arguably, a CS systems student<br>should take that or 152. You need to be a able to understand FPGAs. You can<br>rent FPGAs on AWS now. This isn’t something esoteric as a compute platform.</p>
<p>So should a CS systems person take 189? Should they take 126? There is no way<br>that either of these courses can compete with 127 for a CS system person’s<br>love (and I say this as someone who has taught both 126 and 189). They’re<br>great courses, but not as important. It is all about opportunity costs. Put<br>126 up head-to-head against say 164…. It is hard to say that 126 wins for a<br>CS Systems person. So 189 clearly loses that competition.</p>
<p>So, sure, if a CS Systems oriented person has taken a solid foundation<br>(including 127) and has gone into depth in CS Systems, then they can take<br>further courses as per their interest. If that means taking 189, go for it.<br>Presumably, that person enjoyed 127 and wanted to go further. To learn more<br>about this particular application area for systems that lean heavily on<br>optimization and data.</p>
<h3 id="Followup"><a href="#Followup" class="headerlink" title="Followup:"></a>Followup:</h3><p>Student:<br>We have an entire third/quarter of the class devoted to distributed systems<br>(we’re about to start it in a couple weeks!), and given that it’s the only<br>undergraduate non-special topics course that covers distributed, I’d say it’s<br><em>pretty</em> good!</p>
<p>CS168 is cool, but it concerns itself with more classical networking concepts<br>and doesn’t really cover a lot of the distributed systems/cluster management<br>networking issues until the last few lectures, as a part of “future topics”.</p>
<h2 id="AI-ML-Upper-Div-Class-Path-for-LSCS"><a href="#AI-ML-Upper-Div-Class-Path-for-LSCS" class="headerlink" title="AI/ML Upper Div Class Path for LSCS"></a>AI/ML Upper Div Class Path for LSCS</h2><p>2017-08-01<br>What is a typical class path to take for someone in LSCS who is interested in<br>doing research in Machine Learning, AI, and Data Science?</p>
<p>By the time I declare, I will have taken 61abc, ee16ab, cs c8, cs70, and maybe<br>cs c100. What are some essential Upper Div classes for these fields I should<br>take after I declare and what should be the order of taking those classes?</p>
<p>Also, is taking Math 53 necessary for someone going into this path?</p>
<h3 id="Anant-Sahai’s-answer-1"><a href="#Anant-Sahai’s-answer-1" class="headerlink" title="Anant Sahai’s answer"></a>Anant Sahai’s answer</h3><p>Math 53 is vital. The basic answer is the core fundamental upper-divs in this<br>area are: EECS 126, 127, 189, and 188. 170 is essentially always useful for<br>everyone wherever their interests end up in majors offered by the EECS<br>department. Of these, 170, 126, and 127 can be taken immediately after the<br>lower-division and you will get a lot out of them. You will get a lot more out<br>of 188 and 189 if you take them after these three. (Your goal in research is<br>not to become a good minion as fast as you can, it is to understand the<br>fundamentals so you can absorb more during your inevitable minion-phase.)<br>106AB (robotics) is also pretty important. And 120 going to 128 can be<br>helpful, particularly so on the research side. Math 110 is pretty vital if you<br>really want to be on the research path here. Graduate courses: 229a, 223, 227B<br>are good for theoretical strength and 280, 287, etc. for things connected to<br>specific application domains. There are also a bunch of special topics<br>graduate courses. But by the time you are thinking of taking any graduate<br>course, there should be a graduate student mentor or professor advising you.</p>
<h2 id="CS-189-preparation-Stat-134-Math-110-CS-188"><a href="#CS-189-preparation-Stat-134-Math-110-CS-188" class="headerlink" title="CS 189 preparation: Stat 134, Math 110, CS 188"></a>CS 189 preparation: Stat 134, Math 110, CS 188</h2><p>2017-08-02<br>Have taken Stat 134, Math 110 and CS 188 and looking to take CS 189 next<br>semester. I know Professor Sahai has repeatedly stressed that taking 126, 127<br>and 170 is ideal before 189. My questions are:</p>
<pre><code>1. Is my preparation enough for 189? or should I take 127 and 170 next semester first before I go for 189 (I plan to take 127 and 170 eventually anyways but don’t want to miss out Professor Sahai’s 189)
2. How exactly does taking 127 and 170 before 189 benefit me in learning 189? Since it seems like many people take 127 after 189. 
3. Does it make sense to take 126 after Stat 134? Or should I just take Stat 150/135
</code></pre><p>Thanks!</p>
<h3 id="Anant-Sahai’s-answer-2"><a href="#Anant-Sahai’s-answer-2" class="headerlink" title="Anant Sahai’s answer"></a>Anant Sahai’s answer</h3><p>If you have 134 and 110 under your belt, you probably won’t get wiped out.<br>Because you’ll be comfortable with the probability and the linear algebra, you<br>will be able to concentrate on the machine learning concepts and take them in.<br>Not having optimization will mean that there will be a few times when the<br>simultaneous presence of optimization ideas and new machine learning ideas<br>will cause you to have to work significantly harder, and you might not get as<br>much out of that part as someone with stronger foundations there. The real<br>concern is students who have none of Math110, EECS126/Stat134, EECS127, and<br>CS170. They might be in for real trouble as they have to simultaneously<br>understand probability, linear algebra, optimization, and machine learning. If<br>they also haven’t had EE16AB, then it’s probably completely hopeless to<br>actually understand the concepts. After all, machine learning is essentially<br>the application of optimization within a framework deeply informed by linear-<br>algebraic and probabilistic intuition to problems of data-driven pattern<br>recognition using computers. A certain level of comfort with the tools is<br>extremely helpful. Otherwise, it’s like taking a Sanskrit literature class<br>given in Sanskrit without really understanding Sanskrit. Sure, the point of<br>the Sanskrit literature class is the literature, but not knowing Sanskrit<br>really well is going to cause difficulty.</p>
<p>The unambiguous recommendation for students who have taken 70 is to take 126<br>as their main probability course. This is because 126 can count on 70 and<br>thereby go beyond in many ways, including in connecting more deeply to EECS-<br>relevant applications and probabilistic modeling itself. If you’ve already<br>taken 134, you should have a conversation with the 126 Prof to see whether it<br>is a good fit for you or not.</p>
<h3 id="Followup-1"><a href="#Followup-1" class="headerlink" title="Followup:"></a>Followup:</h3><p>Anant Sahai:<br>That’s the thing. It is very hard to self-study the foundations of probability<br>and optimization, because it is a way of thinking and a perspective rather<br>than specific concepts per se. From a practical perspective, it is probably<br>far more profitable to spend time really reviewing EE16AB, CS70, and Math 53<br>material to make sure you know it very well. There you have the advantage of<br>actually being able to build on courses that you actually took with lectures<br>and discussions that you actually attended to let the ways of thinking seep<br>into your brain, reinforced by homeworks, labs, and exams that you also<br>struggled with and completed. The basic foundations of optimization thinking<br>were laid down for you in 16A (positioning module where least squares was<br>introduced) and 16B (least-norm solutions, psuedoinverses, etc.), The SVD/PCA<br>foundations laid in 16B are of course critical, and the exposure to k-means<br>(Lloyd-Max) in 16B (and 61A for that matter) is helpful. As is using all this<br>stuff in lab and for the project. The foundations of probability were laid<br>down for you in 70, including a probabilistic perspective on the least-squares<br>thinking that you had learned in 16A. From 53, you need to really understand<br>what differentiation means for functions of vectors. (Of course, you saw a bit<br>of this in 16B as well.)</p>
<p>Reviewing your lower-division is something that is actually doable. Beyond<br>that, the next biggest bang-for-the-buck probably comes from understanding<br>multivariate Gaussian distributions, and in particular, the effect of linear<br>transformations on the densities of such Gaussians.</p>
<p>Everything beyond that is likely not worth trying to learn on your own. In<br>that your time would be better spent on strengthening the foundations you have<br>already been exposed to.</p>

<p>**I have some extra cs courses that aren’t ML/AI but just purely interest<br>based</p>
<p>anyways sorry for the long post - if you guys have any good ideas on which one<br>would be more useful for grad school in AI/robotics research that would be<br>awesome</p>
<h3 id="Anant-Sahai’s-answer-3"><a href="#Anant-Sahai’s-answer-3" class="headerlink" title="Anant Sahai’s answer"></a>Anant Sahai’s answer</h3><p>The ML/AI inner core in EECS is pretty clear. In the lower-division, it is<br>Math 53, EE16A, EE16B, and CS70. In the upper-division, it is EECS 126<br>(clearly indicated over Stat 140 or 134 for students that have had 70), 127,<br>and 189. To this, one should almost certainly add 170 and 188. At the<br>undergrad level, this should be rounded out by 106AB in upper division for<br>robotics. (And probably 120 because it is such a common language that you will<br>find others relying on it later.)</p>
<p>But if you really want to pursue this area, then you probably need to go to<br>graduate school. This adds another set of courses and considerations. First,<br>you really want to deepen your mathematical training. For this, the courses<br>Math 110 and 104 are probably essential. You’ll definitely take more Math/Stat<br>in graduate school. So probably taking Math 113 is a good idea for Math<br>breadth, because you might not end up taking it later in graduate school.</p>
<p>The other key to your undergrad training is the selective taking of<br>foundational graduate courses in EECS. The best choices are probably among<br>EE223 (when it is offered — really hard to beat this in terms of<br>foundations), EE229A (information theory), EE227B or 227C (more optimization<br>beyond 127). You don’t have to take all of these by any means — one to two<br>is fine. This is assuming that you are doing undergrad research in the typical<br>way, which means that you are probably learning about more applied things<br>directly. If you want to add in one of the relevant graduate special topics<br>courses that are offered in the learning space (e.g. Deep X), then do it. But<br>really, the cutting edge of the field will keep evolving and so taking the<br>special topics courses when you are a graduate student is probably a better<br>bet. The only reason to take them earlier (while an undergrad here) is that<br>you will probably have to go elsewhere for graduate school. The foundational<br>grad courses in Stat Learning like 281AB can arguably wait for grad school<br>itself since you’re likely to take them then.</p>
<p>The above is a core AI/ML oriented perspective. If you want to add a different<br>tightly synergistic dimension, high performance systems (162, 267, Math 128x)<br>is one nice choice. Another is formal methods (144, 164, 172, etc.). Another<br>is deepening your exposure to control (128, 221A, 222, etc.). Especially if<br>you want to go in the vision or audio or multimedia-related AI/ML side, then<br>deepening your SP exposure (123, 184, 225x, etc.) is a very good idea. There<br>are other choices too that are synergistic.</p>
<p>As you can see, there is plenty to take. Double majoring or anything like that<br>is almost certainly a really bad idea.</p>
<h3 id="Followup-3"><a href="#Followup-3" class="headerlink" title="Followup:"></a>Followup:</h3><p>Student:<br>I also don’t think Math 128A was that valuable, except maybe the numerical<br>linear algebra section (chapter 6). Math 104 I found was good for building my<br>mathematical maturity, but not sure what it’s used for other than in the<br>definitions of statistical estimators (and also CLT definitions and related<br>use real analysis language I guess). I had a question regarding CS 186 though,<br>as someone who wants to pursue data science and has taken Stat 134 (kind of<br>accidentally), is it more important to learn about database construction in<br>186 or would it be better for me to take EE126 and learn some probability<br>applications and stochastic processes? Also, is EE16B useful for machine<br>learning at all because I feel like the SVD will be covered by 127 which I’m<br>100 percent sure I’m taking in spring. Kind of wish we could replace EE16B<br>(definitely would want to skip 16A) with an upper div EE so I could take both<br>CS 186 and EE126 (have limited room in my schedule). Since I’ve taken both<br>Math 54 and 110 I would much rather take EE126 than 16B but I guess that’s not<br>possible with the current CS major policies.</p>
<p>Anant Sahai:<br>It is harder for an undergraduate to appreciate this, but you need to take a<br>bit of a dynamic programming perspective. If you really want to get into these<br>areas, you are going to go to graduate school. This means that you will have<br>plenty of opportunities to take courses then as well. So the question becomes,<br>what do you take now vs what do you take later? This perspective informed my<br>answer. Statistics foundations are something that you certainly have to build<br>at some point (to have a well-rounded education in this space), so the<br>question is when. I believe that there are good reasons that those foundations<br>are better built when you are a graduate student. While the ones that I listed<br>were more important to prioritize as an undergraduate. A part of the reason is<br>that foundational breadth also impacts your choice of potential advisers and<br>projects as you begin graduate school. Not having Stat 135 almost certainly<br>closes no doors. Not having 126 or 127 can definitely close doors (to take an<br>extreme example). There is often a qualitative difference between the first<br>couple of things that you do as a PhD student and the last couple of things.<br>What is good to take early are things that are qualitatively maturity-<br>enhancing, broadly useful skill-granting, and/or mind-expanding.</p>
<p>Student:<br>Here are some of my opinions:</p>
<p>You listed robotics/AI/ML, but I think that’s a pretty large area. Not saying<br>that you need a specific focus so early in your undergraduate career, but you<br>should probably narrow it down eventually.</p>
<p>The utility of Stat 135 depends on how much <em>statistical learning</em> you want to<br>do. Think of it this way: If you are interested in AI/ML because you want to<br>build learning algorithms or intelligent agents, then perhaps it ‘s not as<br>important to you. I think you could get by with knowledge of optimization and<br>probability. On the other hand, if you are interested in foundational<br>questions (such as: is it even possible to learn? what is the nature of a good<br>statistical estimator? what is the behavior of common estimators<br>asymptotically?) then you’ll probably want to take more statistics courses.<br>The former is about ML as a part of AI; the latter is about ML as a part of<br>statistical inference.</p>
<p>I don’t think Math 128A is very valuable. Perhaps 128B or 221 will be better<br>for your purposes.</p>
<p>Also some general thoughts. As contradictory as this sounds, I think you<br>should try to prioritize both a strong foundation and depth. Foundation<br>meaning courses like Math 104. While you’re taking Math 104 you may not see<br>why it is important or useful, but you don’t want to go into graduate courses<br>feeling shaky about fundamental math concepts. Undergraduate is your time to<br>build these fundamentals anyway. By depth I mean figuring out a more specific<br>interest (e.g. spectral graph theory) and then learning more about it. For a<br>topic as specific as that, you probably won’t find much besides special topics<br>courses and maybe one introductory graduate course, so you might need to pick<br>up some books for outside reading.</p>
<p>It might seem like I’m saying you should do everything, so to make it clearer,<br>I don’t recommend that you take a lot of non-foundational undergraduate<br>courses. For example I wouldn’t recommend that you take (this is just a crazy<br>example) EE 105, 106A/B, 113, 117, 120, 121, 130, 134, and then CS 169, 172,<br>186, … That would be a plan without much synergy or thought, and I don’t<br>think it would prepare you very well for anything.</p>
<p>Student:</p>
<p>Student:<br>I would say if you’re a rising sophomore, in EECS, sign up for faculty<br>advising and ask these questions to your advisor. There are certain back and<br>forth question schemes that are ill suited to piazza. Your faculty advisor<br>should be able to answer these questions.</p>
<p>Student:<br>there’s a cs289b?</p>
<p>Student:<br>Also, as a follow up: you mentioned several synergistic clusters in<br>specialized fields. I’ll be taking Math128A next semester which seemingly fits<br>into the “high performance systems” cluster; however, is there a class or<br>venue where I can explore the different topics and figure out what I have<br>interest in?</p>
<h3 id="Followup-4"><a href="#Followup-4" class="headerlink" title="Followup:"></a>Followup:</h3><p>Student:<br>Again I think it depends on what area of ML/AI you’re going into. If you<br>really want to do a lot of statistical learning (asymptotic behavior of<br>estimators, for example) then you probably want to go for Stat 135, Stat<br>210A/B (and whatever preparation you need to get there). If you want to tackle<br>even more foundational issues (e.g. an important example is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Finetti%27s_theorem" target="_blank" rel="external">de Finetti’s<br>theorem</a> and it’s<br>relationship to Bayesian statistics), then you may want to take Stat 205A/B<br>(which probably means taking Math 202A at least).</p>

<p>Multiple topics from 16AB are very relevant to 189. First, there is the spirit<br>of casting problems into optimization problems. This will be leveraged and<br>built upon. This shows up in the Linear Regression parts of 16A. It also shows<br>up in the SVD sections of 16B. These are perhaps the most directly relevant.<br>After that, there is the whole circuits perspective on information processing<br>which shows up in the neural nets parts of 189 — which are basically<br>circuits that do information processing. The sections of 16B (and a tad in the<br>locationing lab for 16A) where you see how nonlinear functions can be<br>linearized in a neighborhood is also quite important in 189.</p>

What does he interpret machine<br>learning as? Prof. Recht viewed ML as EE 126 + EE 127 + backprop (read this<br>somewhere on this piazza). Prof. Shewchuk supposedly focuses more on ML<br>concepts.</p>
<p>[Disclaimer: I never taken CS 189 hence I don’t know how true these statements<br>are.]</p>
<h3 id="Anant-Sahai’s-answer-6"><a href="#Anant-Sahai’s-answer-6" class="headerlink" title="Anant Sahai’s answer"></a>Anant Sahai’s answer</h3><p>I am talking to the past instructors of the course because I believe that it<br>is important to have some degree of consistency, but my basic philosophy is<br>that ML is fundamentally about learning, which is about discovering patterns<br>in a way that can be represented and leveraged in a useful manner — for both<br>active interaction and passive understanding. In that way, ML is at the<br>intersection of control and signal processing, with an underlying connection<br>to information theory and statistics. I would want my students to understand<br>the fundamentals here, including the core tradeoffs. I also want them to<br>understand how the optimization paradigm applies to this domain because this<br>helps gain some understanding of informational vs computational limits. The<br>different ML techniques and approaches are vehicles for conveying an<br>understanding of how to think better, not some grab-bag of tools.</p>
<p>In my ideal world, I would teach 189 to students who have already taken both<br>126 and 127 (so that I could concentrate on the ML aspects as opposed to<br>probability and optimization aspects bottlenecking student understanding), as<br>well as of course the full EECS lower division. But that would be too radical<br>of a change from precedent and policy. However, following department policy, I<br>am going to freely assume and rely on a mastery of the EECS lower division,<br>where because of the nature of the material this is going to fall most<br>specifically on 16AB and 70 as well as Math 53. I am also going to assume<br>maturity corresponding to the nature of the course — 189 is not like 126,<br>127, and 170 which are meant to be taken among the first set of upper-division<br>courses. 189 is meant to be taken with more maturity. In terms of teaching<br>philosophy, my belief remains that students learn best when they work hard and<br>are challenged.</p>

<h3 id="Anant-Sahai’s-answer-10"><a href="#Anant-Sahai’s-answer-10" class="headerlink" title="Anant Sahai’s answer"></a>Anant Sahai’s answer</h3><p>From my perspective as someone who teaches 189, the following makes the most<br>sense:</p>
<p>1) If you have taken 16AB and 110, and have strong vector calculus, the single<br>most important course to prepare for 189 is 126. This continues to hold as<br>long as you have taken 16AB and do not have have some weakness in vector<br>calculus or linear algebra. Being able to reason probabilistically and have<br>intuition about it is very important. 70 is not really enough.</p>
<p>2) If you have weakness in linear algebra or vector calculus or have not taken<br>16AB, then 127 is the most important course to prepare for 189. You will<br>experience significant difficulties without that understanding.</p>
<p>3) If you have taken 16AB and 127, for many students, taking 110 could become<br>largely redundant. A student in that position should take the 110 textbook and<br>read it on their own. See if you need more.</p>
<p>Of course, hopefully everyone understands that both 126 and 127 are <em>more</em><br>fundamental courses to take than 189 if you are interested in machine<br>learning. And if you have to pick only one of the three courses: 126, 127, and<br>189; then 127 is clearly the most important one to take for students<br>regardless of their area. There are lots of machine learning applications in<br>127.</p>
<p>In light of this, the most reasonable course of action is for interested<br>students to take both 126 and 127 before 189. And if because of time pressure<br>to graduate they want to take one concurrently with 189, that course is likely</p>
<ol>
<li>(Although it is better understood as taking 189 concurrently with 127.)</li>
</ol>
<p>Courses are far more rewarding if you can really understand what is going on.<br>None of these courses are gratuitously difficult or anything like that, but<br>truly engaging with the material does require hard work and building up your<br>understanding.</p>
<p>I understand that the fashionable name and interesting subject matter of 189<br>is appealing, but when you’re seven weeks into the course, trust me, no amount<br>of fashionability is going to help you out or even make you feel any better.<br>Understanding probability and optimization well will.</p>
<h3 id="Followup-9"><a href="#Followup-9" class="headerlink" title="Followup:"></a>Followup:</h3><p>Student:<br>The reason I asked it here is that professors/course staff would know better<br>how much overlap there is between said courses.</p>

<p>I was wondering which class would be best to phase II, as I’m only allowed<br>13.5 units for phase 1, and these classes are 15 units combined. How difficult<br>is it to get into 189 during phase 2?</p>
<h3 id="Anant-Sahai’s-answer-11"><a href="#Anant-Sahai’s-answer-11" class="headerlink" title="Anant Sahai’s answer"></a>Anant Sahai’s answer</h3><p>Unless there is something radically unusual about your mathematical<br>background, please don’t attempt to take 189 early. 189’s core lower-div<br>prereqs are 16A <em>and</em> 16B. Absolute mastery of both those courses is critical.<br>189 definitely counts on significantly more than 70 in terms of maturity and<br>background. You also need to be able to program easily at the level of having<br>mastered 61B. And vector calculus to a level <em>beyond</em> that done in Math 53.</p>
<p>Remember, if you have to take only two machine-learning relevant courses from<br>EECS, those two courses are 126 and 127. They are more fundamental than 189<br>and ideally, you will have taken at least one of them (ideally both) before<br>taking 189. Both of them are filled with diverse applications, real code<br>writing, real data, etc….</p>
<p>Here is a difficulty ramp:</p>
<p>Easiest = 16A, then 16B, then 70, then 126/127, then 189 = Hardest. Each step<br>up on this ramp should make you work and grow, in a way that you’ll be sore<br>but not injured.</p>
<p>189 is not a joke. It does nobody any good to have you take 189 and not<br>understand what is going on. You are not here to learn buzzwords, be<br>fashionable, or make cocktail party conversation. You’re here to really learn<br>stuff that will form the foundations of a multi-decade career.</p>

<p>Of course, CS 170 would seem like the next step, but apart from that, I was<br>hoping I could get some recommendations!</p>

<p>162 and 149 are arguably the most core for someone who wants to be a versatile<br>“non-mathy” software engineer, to which one could add 169, 160 and probably<br>168 as well. 161 and 186 are also solid courses for this path.</p>

IMO these are good considerations if you are aiming to do some sort<br>of web development (CS169 might also be good for this since it’s fairly<br>similar to what you’ll be doing in the webdev industry but that’s also a<br>reason not to take it so you can take more things that are interesting to<br>you).</p>
<p>Apart from these, it really depends on what field you want to go into. For<br>example, if you want to go into AI/ML, you should probably take 188/189. If<br>you want to go into graphics or VR, 184/194-26/(Grad Computer Vision Course;<br>forgot the course number) would be good to take. Etc.</p>
<h3 id="Followup-13"><a href="#Followup-13" class="headerlink" title="Followup:"></a>Followup:</h3><p>Student:<br>Thank you!</p>
<p>Anant Sahai:<br>The answer to this is also very clear.</p>
<p>If you want to get the most out of 189, take both 126 and 127 before taking</p>
<ol>
<li>Then, your understanding of 189 will be significantly deeper.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you have taken the standard sequence: 16A, 16B, and 70, (with math 53 in<br>there as well) the next course to take is 126. Full stop. Then, if you feel<br>very comfortable with the linear algebra and have absorbed the basic<br>optimization problem modeling ideas from 16AB, you can in principle take 189.<br>You’d be better off having taken 127 (which by the way is filled with lots of<br>machine learning applications) as well, but you will still get a lot out of<br>189 and not be lost.</p>
<p>If for whatever reason you have not taken 16AB, then definitely take 127<br>first. Then, you can take 189 if you feel that your probability intuition is<br>strong. (Not sure how it would actually get strong without having had 126, but<br>maybe you took some other set of courses that really strengthened your<br>probability intuition.) If your probability intuition is weak, then there are<br>going to be parts of 189 where you will basically get slammed and there will<br>be aspects of the story that you won’t be able to properly internalize. But,<br>with 127 under your belt, you’ll still be able to make it through.</p>
<p>Again, best case: take 126 and 127 first, then take 189. After that, if you’ve<br>taken 16AB, 126 probably is more important than 127 as a foundation, but 127<br>has way more machine learning in it.</p>
<p>If you can only choose two of the three to take, the answer is unambiguously<br>to take 126 and 127. With those solidly under your belt, you can essentially<br>self-study 189 if you need to. The reverse is not possible. There’s a way of<br>thinking that 126 and 127 convey that is very hard to get without taking the<br>course. Meanwhile, the way of thinking that 189 teaches that goes beyond<br>126/127 is largely obtainable by the world teaching you.</p>
<p>To use a machine learning perspective, if your prior is initialized properly<br>by 126 and 127, then stochastic gradient descent by doing real world problems<br>and reading papers will make your inner understanding converge to what 189 is<br>trying to teach you. But if you don’t have 126 and 127, you will very likely<br>get stuck in a bad local minimum. All 189 does is speed up the convergence.</p>

<p>A little bit about myself: I’m an applied math major with a stats minor doing<br>my cluster in statistical learning. I’ve taken Stat 153 and CS 170 as part of<br>my 3-course cluster, and currently trying to decide which one to take for my<br>3rd. I am very interested in ML/prediction models (in any field, really). I’ve<br>only taken 61A/B, and I don’t feel very passionate about programming as a<br>career, so working as a software engineer isn’t really an option for me.<br>Unfortunately, as much as I’d like, going to grad school isn’t currently an<br>option for me either, at least in the foreseeable future (due to various<br>issues surrounding finance, immigration status, etc.).</p>
<p>With all this being said, how helpful would CS 189 be for me? Is it more of an<br>introductory grad-school ML course, heavy on theory and little applications?<br>I’ve heard this class involves A LOT of work, and as much as I’d like to take<br>it as an academic interest, time is a big factor and I don’t think I’m able to<br>do that if there’s a “better” option for me.</p>
<p>Would those teaching/have taught CS 189 and have taken it recommend I go with<br>CS 189 with industry in mind, or maybe take something like EE 127 instead?<br>Thanks for your time.</p>
<h3 id="Anant-Sahai’s-answer-18"><a href="#Anant-Sahai’s-answer-18" class="headerlink" title="Anant Sahai’s answer"></a>Anant Sahai’s answer</h3><p>189 is a balanced course: a reasonably solid grounding in basic theory plus<br>basic implementation plus application to different settings. It is cross-<br>listed as 289A and is generally an advanced upper-division course, expecting<br>students to have significant mathematical maturity. There is no getting around<br>the fact that it is a lot of work. You learn a lot, but you have to work<br>really hard.</p>
<p>From an industry point of view, there is no doubt that it helps to have a<br>machine learning course under your belt, at least at the very beginning. For<br>students without a large amount of mathematical background, we recommend<br>taking either 126 or 127 before taking 189. Both of these courses are<br>conceptually core to the machine learning area. The probability and facility<br>in working with probability in 126 helps you think and reason in a way that<br>helps. The optimization intuition and problem modeling practice from 127 helps<br>with both thinking and understanding. From a fundamentals perspective, if you<br>have a solid understanding of 126 and 127, you can learn machine learning from<br>books and other resources. The reverse is definitely not true.</p>
<p>In your case, it all depends on your facility with probability and modeling<br>thinking — how much did Stat 153 hit? You haven’t had EE16AB that hit a<br>bunch of optimization thinking and problem modeling. EECS 127 is a safe bet.<br>189 might be risky.</p>

For example, although I’m very<br>interested in Math 104, 110, and somewhat interested in classes in the<br>Statistics cluster for the major (153, 155), I’m not sure if it’s worth taking<br>Math 113, 128A, 185. I’m a second year, so admittedly I have quite a bit of<br>time, but I’m curious is it generally better to just take the classes you<br>really want to, even if it means just coming shy of obtaining another degree?<br>I’d probably try to do a Master’s, but I can’t say at this point if I want to<br>do a PhD, so I’m not sure if mathematical maturity justifies classes like 113<br>and 185. It also sucks that they take the place of some (graduate) classes I<br>find more interesting in the Math/Stats department (Math 170, Math 202A, Stat<br>205A, etc.)</p>

<p>In general though, my opinion is that double majors are not a good idea unless<br>you should want to take all the required courses anyway, with possibly one<br>course of exception. Why should? Because you might not actually know how your<br>interests translate into courses that you should take. So get advice from<br>faculty.</p>

<p>Student:<br>I can’t speak to 126 as I haven’t taken it, but I’m currently taking 120 and<br>127; they are both very doable if you’ve taken 16A and 16B as they lean<br>heavily on things covered in those classes. 127 is much harder conceptually in<br>my opinion but definitely doable with only 1-2 other techs if you did well in<br>16AB. Having a strong intuition about the concepts in Math 53 is also<br>essential. 120 is conceptually easier IMO and picks up literally where 16B<br>leaves off with convolution and LTI Systems.</p>
<p>So, overall, they’re both great classes, but 127 requires a bit more<br>mathematical maturity IMO.</p>

<p>I am currently taking CS162 and I am very worried about the class - it’s only<br>been 3 lectures in, and I am confused already. I am not very good at low-level<br>programming concepts and I hated 61C. I enjoy theoretical computer science<br>(CS70, CS170, CS188) so much more and I was wondering if P/NPing 162 would<br>impact my job prospects or grad school prospects (MS or MBA either). I have no<br>intention of ever going into a hardware-oriented company or studying anything<br>about the OS for grad school. 162 has been stressing me out and I have a lot<br>of other extracurriculars on my plate and I don’t want my GPA to tank because<br>of this course. BTW, I am a CS major.</p>
<p>Hoping a professor like @Anant Sahai and reply to this. It’s stressing me out<br>a lot.</p>
<h3 id="Instructor-answer-1"><a href="#Instructor-answer-1" class="headerlink" title="Instructor answer"></a>Instructor answer</h3><p>(Are students allowed to P/NP technical courses? I don’t know the answer to<br>that question but am pretty sure that this is something that wouldn’t be fair<br>to do to your project group if the course has projects.)</p>
<p>Now, I can just speak to the technical dimension. 162 is a really great course<br>and it is super important for anyone who wants to be a hardcore software<br>engineer. It should be the foundation of your software engineering upper-div<br>education. However, EECS isn’t just for software engineers which is why we<br>don’t require it to be taken. (By contrast, many traditional CS programs do<br>require the counterpart of 162. For example UCLA I believe requires operating<br>systems, programming languages, digital design, networking, algorithms, and<br>automata theory. These kinds of courses are the heart of a traditional CS<br>program.)</p>
<p>There is however, many entirely different worlds of things that you could<br>study. You could go hardcore into hardware and take courses like 105, 151,<br>149, 152, 170, 147, and 149 for another perfectly reasonable education. That<br>remains both practically relevant and grad-school relevant.</p>
<p>Or you could go into the AI/ML side and take courses like 126, 127, 189, 188,<br>120, 170, 106A, 106B. This is a more theoretical side orientation, with a<br>practical anchoring in robotics. A completely reasonable education. Definitely<br>employable and grad-school relevant. (Perhaps not as widely employable at the<br>bachelor’s level yet as the traditional CS training, but that is changing<br>fast.)</p>
<p>So you don’t have to take 162. But you kind of do have to take either 162&amp;168<br>or 151&amp;149 or 126&amp;127 to be in a reasonable place. Our requirements might be<br>quite flexible, but it doesn’t mean that anything that satisfies them is<br>actually a good idea. You need to have real depth and solid foundations in<br>something.</p>
<p>-–</p>
<p>On a policy level, L&amp;S CS students can change their grading option to P/NP<br>until the deadline. However, the course will not fulfill a requirement and you<br>will need an additional upper division CS course in its place. EECS majors can<br>only P/NP technical courses if they’ve already fulfilled all the relevant<br>requirements.</p>

For<br>reference, the papers I’ve been assigned are on ml/reinforcement learning, and<br>the upperdivs I’ve taken are 170, 110, 188, and 126 (I’m taking 189 this<br>semester).</p>
<p>Anyway I guess I’m looking at general advice on how to read research papers,<br>and wondering how much struggle is normal vs how much is due to an<br>insufficient background).</p>
<h3 id="Anant-Sahai’s-answer-23"><a href="#Anant-Sahai’s-answer-23" class="headerlink" title="Anant Sahai’s answer"></a>Anant Sahai’s answer</h3><p>You need to be willing to read actively. First step, don’t try to read on a<br>screen. Print out the papers and get a notebook, a highlighter, and sticky<br>notes. Expect to spend something like 1 hour per page on average when you are<br>starting out. (It gets better.) Skim the entire paper. Just let it wash over<br>you first. You will understand almost nothing. That’s normal. Then read the<br>abstract, introduction, and conclusion. Try to write in your own words what<br>you now expect to learn from reading the paper. Then read the paper again<br>slowly and make a list of questions as you go. Go one level deep of looking up<br>Wikipedia article. But keep writing down questions about what stuff means.</p>
<p>Then, go and talk to your mentor. Explain what you think the point of the<br>paper is and then ask questions about what you don’t understand. They should<br>teach you.</p>
<p>The most important thing in starting doing research is the quality of the<br>mentoring. The specific topic is insignificant by comparison.</p>
<p>You have to be willing to accept that you don’t understand. Without 189 and<br>127 under your belt, it is absolutely natural for you to have huge gaps in<br>your understanding. But good mentoring can help fill these gaps.</p>

<h3 id="Anant-Sahai’s-answer-24"><a href="#Anant-Sahai’s-answer-24" class="headerlink" title="Anant Sahai’s answer"></a>Anant Sahai’s answer</h3><p>189 is firmly in the mathy camp, with some programming in essentially each<br>homework along the way to help you understand the math properly as well as how<br>to use it. The closest comparison would be the HWs from the 16AB series (which<br>makes sense, since those are the freshman-level pre-ML/AI courses). Except for<br>the freshmen courses, there is a ton of scaffolding and handholding. For an<br><em>advanced</em> undergraduate course like 189, there is far far less. In that<br>sense, there is a lot more programming in 189 than in 16AB. But we’re not<br>talking about writing programs that are thousands of lines long by a long<br>shot.</p>

Is this knowledge<br>enough for me to not fall behind in CS 189? Or should I take 170 first then<br>189 during my final semester? I just want to take 189 a bit earlier because<br>I’m afraid I won’t get into the class (non-major), and enrolling in it Spring<br>2017 gives me another “chance” to get into it during the next Fall.

<p>If you’ve had ee16a and ee16b and cs70, the single next best class to prepare<br>is 126.</p>
<p>If you haven’t had ee16a and ee16b, the next single best class to prepare is<br>127.</p>
<p>In general, 126 and 127 are both way more directly relevant to 189 than any<br>other upper division course. Math 110 is also useful, but certainly not<br>necessary if the others are present.</p>
<p>For non-majors, 127 or a similar course is your best bet to prepare.</p>

<p>Student:<br>126 cannot replace 134 for stats. you can, however, choose to take stat c205a<br>to replace 134 and if you know math 104 material and have some amount of math<br>105/202a you should be fine in 205a after 126.</p>

The downside of doing this is that one will have to self-study for the<br>circuits portion of EE16A before venturing into EE16B. However, most of you<br>(including the instructors) go on to say that there are numerous resources to<br>aid in closing any knowledge gaps in the circuits portion of the class. So, my<br>question is, can someone please post the link to said resources? (I’ll be<br>taking EE16A this fall, and I have neither Linear Algebra nor Circuit<br>experience. I have, however started reviewing L.A, and would wanna start on<br>reviewing Circuits beforehand)</p>
<h3 id="Anant-Sahai’s-answer-31"><a href="#Anant-Sahai’s-answer-31" class="headerlink" title="Anant Sahai’s answer"></a>Anant Sahai’s answer</h3><p>You don’t need to practice circuits ahead of taking 16A. But if you want<br>videos, there are actually nice circuits-oriented web-accessible videos at:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ntspress.com/publications/circuits-second-
edition/circuits-2e-faculty-resources/circuits-videos-from-berkeleys-ee-40/" target="_blank" rel="external">http://www.ntspress.com/publications/circuits-second-
edition/circuits-2e-faculty-resources/circuits-videos-from-berkeleys-ee-40/</a></p>
<p>However, these are not taught in the same spirit as 16A. In fact, the spirit<br>is very different. So, while they can conceivably help someone prepare for 16B<br>in terms of circuit analysis skills assuming that person knows linear-algebra,<br>there are no resources that really talk about circuits the way that 16A talks<br>about circuits. This is because the pedagogic goals in 16A are different from<br>a typical “intro to circuits” class. 16A isn’t an “intro to circuits” class.<br>It is far more accurate overall to view 16A and 16B as “pre-EECS” courses with<br>a strong “pre-machine-learning and pre-AI” bent.</p>
<p>As an incoming student who is going to be taking 16A, all you need is a solid<br>understanding of high-school math, humility, curiosity, an open mind, and a<br>willingness to work hard.</p>

<p>Does anyone know whether it will be out in the spring? I’m enrolled in DS 100<br>right now, but if there’s no chance at a data science major, I’ll probably<br>drop it and take Stat 133 instead because my backup as of now is Statistics<br>with a CS concentration.</p>

<h3 id="Followup-29"><a href="#Followup-29" class="headerlink" title="Followup:"></a>Followup:</h3><p>Anant Sahai:<br>I think that 154 is a great course, and the fact that it uses R instead of<br>Python is a small difference.</p>
<p>Stat 154 can’t lean on the entire EECS Lower Division, but it can lean on Stat</p>
<ol>
<li>This results in many differences. Stat 154 is also solidly an<br>undergraduate course while 189 is also the entry-level graduate course 289A,<br>and is hence arguably a few shades faster and more advanced. Basically, 189<br>goes further and has less review in it. The revised 189 has more conceptual<br>alignments with 154 in terms of the order in which we teach things, but 189<br>goes faster and has harder homework. As a result, 189 will cover many things<br>this semester that won’t be touched upon in 154 — most notably more material<br>connected to neural nets. 154 seems to be more welcoming as a potential entry-<br>level upper-division course overall in its structure, while 189 really needs<br>students to have a level of maturity beyond what the lower-division provides.<br>There are some other topics in which 154 goes into more depth.</li>

I found that the EE<br>department offers some courses (128 and 221A came to mind), but my EE<br>knowledge is pretty basic (I only took EE 16A).

<h3 id="Anant-Sahai’s-answer-35"><a href="#Anant-Sahai’s-answer-35" class="headerlink" title="Anant Sahai’s answer"></a>Anant Sahai’s answer</h3><p>Advice about taking Physics courses has three different intended benefits,<br>relative to a hypothetical plain “computer science or math” major.</p>
<pre><code>1. Physics training boosts your generic ability to think. The traditional foundation of an engineering education, good physics courses just make you stronger.
2. Physics training helps in modeling problems and in seeing where mathematical definitions are coming from, and helps refine a physical/mathematical intuition. In the Berkeley context, one of the reasons that we now recommend the EE16AB series to all incoming freshmen in EECS and intended CS is for hitting both (1) and (2) above. Most places have nothing like this for vanilla CS degrees. 
3. More advanced topics in Physics like upper-division courses in classical mechanics as well as statistical mechanics bring in the connection to optimization and minimization principles. Upper-division electromagnetism courses also help one internalize the idea of dropping terms and trying to zoom in on the quantitative essence of a problem. There is a reason that EE16AB have an optimization thread running through them, but as freshmen courses, they cannot exercise the skills involved in aggressively dropping terms and caricaturing problems. (EE105 does that in the context of circuit theory.)
</code></pre><p>So, in the Berkeley context, if you’re interested in AI/ML, remember the core<br>courses from our department: 16A, 16B, 70, 126, 127, 189. Ideally taken in<br>roughly that order. Outside of our department, you definitely should be taking<br>Math 110. It is recommended that you take Physics 7A and 7B as well (there’s a<br>reason they’re required for EECS). Ideally, you would also take upper-division<br>classical mechanics and statistical mechanics, but exposure to other upper-<br>division or graduate courses in EE can also exercise the same mental muscles.<br>And of course, within the department at the upper-div, we have courses like<br>188, 128, 106AB, as well as graduate courses like 229A that are accessible to<br>well prepared undergrads and extremely helpful for ML/AI type thinking.</p>
<h3 id="Followup-33"><a href="#Followup-33" class="headerlink" title="Followup:"></a>Followup:</h3><p>Student:<br>The essence of this question is within another one: Do you believe you will<br>put in substantial effort into a course you have taken Pass/No Pass, or will<br>you treat it as an occasional opportunity to learn something new?</p>
<p>If you believe that you will put in effort into all the course material and<br>exercise your mental muscles regardless of the grading scheme, then it is<br>irrelevant whether you take it for a letter grade. On the other hand, if you<br>plan to put the class on your back-burner and use it to pretty-up your<br>transcript, or if your approach to the class is to have it “over with” but on<br>record, then it defeats the intellectual purpose of taking the class.</p>

I have exempted math 1a/1b/53. I’m really interested<br>in math and want to take upper div math classes, but it seems that Math 54 is<br>a prereq for the upper div math classes like 110 and 104 and required for a<br>math minor which I may be interested in. Apparently, however, ee16a/b cover<br>almost all the material that math 54 covers. So I am asking do I still need to<br>take 54? If not, what sequence of math classes should I take and when should I<br>take them?</p>
<h3 id="Instructor-answer-3"><a href="#Instructor-answer-3" class="headerlink" title="Instructor answer"></a>Instructor answer</h3><p>You do not need to take Math 54 for the EECS major. It sounds like you’re<br>planning to take this course for math department requirements (minor, course<br>pre-reqs), so you will need to check with their staff.</p>
<h2 id="189-preparation"><a href="#189-preparation" class="headerlink" title="189 preparation"></a>189 preparation</h2><p>2017-07-31<br>which class is more useful for prepping for 189 - stats 134 or math 53?</p>
<p>Also how difficult/time consuming is stats 134?</p>
<h3 id="Anant-Sahai’s-answer-36"><a href="#Anant-Sahai’s-answer-36" class="headerlink" title="Anant Sahai’s answer"></a>Anant Sahai’s answer</h3><p>For 189, the core prep that is absolutely required is: Math 53, EE16A, EE16B,<br>and CS70. (Or equivalents of these — the concepts in these courses are<br>leaned on very hard in 189.) On top of this, it is useful to add EECS 126<br>and/or EECS 127. Having these will help you concentrate on learning the actual<br>machine-learning parts as opposed to facing interference from having an<br>insufficiently intuitive grasp of probability and optimization. After those,<br>the next one, which is not as preferable as the ones listed above, is CS188.<br>This is because it provides you with an exposure to some of the relevant<br>ideas. Better than that would DS100. But that’s not as good as 126 or 127.</p>
<h3 id="Followup-34"><a href="#Followup-34" class="headerlink" title="Followup:"></a>Followup:</h3><p>Anant Sahai:<br>The entire lower-division is fair game for all upper-division courses — the<br>lower division represents the background that we expect all students to<br>possess. (The nature of the material also has an effect. I don’t expect that<br>we’ll need to make much reference to material in say 61C, but i would have no<br>qualms about expecting programming maturity at that level. So, if someone<br>wanted to add CUDA programming as an aspect of a problem in 189, that would be<br>totally fair.)</p>
<p>Please remember also that 189 is an advanced upper-division course, it is not<br>an entry level upper-division course. We are going to be assuming maturity<br>commensurate with that. Nobody should take 189 as their first upper division<br>EECS department course. There are plenty of other courses that are aimed to be<br>entry-level upper-div: 126 and 127 (for the AI/SP/Control oriented), 170 (for<br>everyone), 120 (for the SP/Control/Graphics oriented), 105 (Circuits<br>oriented), 162 (systems programming oriented), and 100 (data science<br>oriented).</p>
<p>If you have the maturity (especially the mathematical maturity), then learning<br>the relevant material from the freshman-level 16AB series shouldn’t be too<br>hard.</p>

(Side note: I haven’t taken Math 54 yet,<br>which means I have zero experience with linear algebra. Is it advisable to<br>study Math 54 material first? If so, which areas of Math 54 should I focus on<br>that are of significant use in EE16A?)</p>
<h3 id="Anant-Sahai’s-answer-37"><a href="#Anant-Sahai’s-answer-37" class="headerlink" title="Anant Sahai’s answer"></a>Anant Sahai’s answer</h3><p>16A teaches you everything linear-algebraic from first principles.</p>
<p>Actually, you have seen some linear algebra in high school and junior high —<br>solving systems of linear equations.</p>
<p>$$5x + 2y + 3z = 8$$</p>
<p>$$2x + 2y + 3z = 8$$</p>
<p>$$12x - 2y + z = 0$$</p>
<p>That sort of thing.</p>
<p>If you’re nervous, make sure you can do that. Review your high school<br>geometry, trigonometry, and basic calculus.</p>
<p>If you want to get ahead, and you’re someone that really approaches the world<br>rooted in physical intuition, maybe you could review your high school physics<br>as it pertains to electromagnetism. The treatment in 16AB abstracts away most<br>of the physics, but teaches circuit analysis more from a linear algebraic<br>perspective that also engages with an intuition about how these quantities<br>behave.</p>
<p>16A has the same programming prereqs as 61A and also wants you to be at least<br>taking 61A or DS8 in parallel. It doesn’t really teach you Python programming,<br>so if you want to review that, do so.</p>
<p>But relax and be willing to work hard without distractions and an open curious<br>mind. That’s all that 16A really requires.</p>

But I just need some suggestions for my current<br>situation.</p>
<p>I am a rising sophomore and I have declared L&amp;S CS and Applied Math majors. I<br>have taken Math 54 and 110. I enrolled in EE16A during phase 1 and am<br>currently at waitlist #85. I have my phase 2 tomorrow. As the instructor in<br>@4595 said, EE16A will not expand anymore. And as a lot of places suggest, it<br>is more recommended to take EE16B. Is it worth it for me to switch to EE16B<br>since that class is a lot less full?</p>
<h3 id="Anant-Sahai’s-answer-38"><a href="#Anant-Sahai’s-answer-38" class="headerlink" title="Anant Sahai’s answer"></a>Anant Sahai’s answer</h3><p>It is more recommended for students who have the mathematical maturity,<br>clarity of thought, and linear algebra background to take EE16B. You’ll get a<br>lot more out of it. (Of course, it is better to have taken 16AB as freshmen.<br>But I can understand how a student who came in as a freshman last year didn’t<br>understand that. The freshmen coming in this year should understand this.)</p>
<p>Yes, the circuits material in 16A appears to span 6ish weeks of the 16A term.<br>However, it has to be remembered that this material is designed to be a<br>vehicle to help build fundamental thinking and analytic skills, as well as<br>mathematical and modeling maturity in freshmen students. For somebody who<br>already has mental muscles in these areas developed to the appropriate skill<br>levels, it should be much faster to self-study the material to the point that<br>you can successfully navigate 16B.</p>
<p>The basics of KCL (flow conservation in a graph) and modeling basic linear<br>circuit elements using linear systems of equations — that’s pretty fast<br>(maybe 1/3 of a page of a cheat sheet). The concept of ground is just<br>resolving a single degree of freedom by locking it down. Norton/Thevenin<br>equivalence is a simple consequence of linearity and can be viewed as<br>something that emerges naturally from Gaussian Elimination’s step-by-step<br>algorithm. Series/Parallel connections of resistors is an exercise, and can be<br>viewed as a simplification rule to skip steps. Superposition is another simple<br>consequence of linearity. Golden-rule op-amps are just another element with<br>simple rules — giving rise to basically three equations. (two currents are<br>zero and one pair of node voltages must agree). There are a couple of simple<br>patterns that you need to recognize. Capacitance is yet another concept that<br>just ties charge instead of current to voltage. Charge sharing is a simple<br>consequence of charge conservation. Comparators are a simple sign<br>nonlinearity. Everything fits on maybe 1.5 pages of a cheat sheet, if that.<br>There is also the very important design side of the thinking skills being<br>taught, and if all you’ve done is analysis or ad-hoc-ery in other courses,<br>that might provide challenges for you. But being able to do systematic design<br>thinking is very important to being a CS Major.</p>
<p>Running through the 16A circuits problems is a simple matter of practice, and<br>somebody who already has the mental muscles to the right place, can probably<br>get all of this in maybe 10-20 hours max of total investment. Certainly, that<br>will let you hit 16B running, and you can catch up as the 16B course is going.<br>If something sticks or is more challenging, then there is almost certainly<br>some weakness in a general-purpose mental muscle that you have been<br>compensating for by using other mental muscles in other courses. Good for you<br>to find this gap, now you can fix it and get better mental form overall.</p>

However, it seems like this<br>recommendation is more grounded in “mathematical maturity” vs. actual content<br>relevance and concrete preparation for CS 70.</p>
<p>I am curious to know why EE 16A is preferred over math 54, and how the<br>material specifically more closely aligns with CS 70?

<h3 id="Anant-Sahai’s-answer-39"><a href="#Anant-Sahai’s-answer-39" class="headerlink" title="Anant Sahai’s answer"></a>Anant Sahai’s answer</h3><p>There are recursive algorithms in 16A and 16B, and they are talked about in a<br>way that helps you think about them better. 16A and 16B are largely about<br>teaching you how to think, as is 70. The focus on modeling and components of<br>systematic thinking is stronger in 16AB, and the course sequence was designed<br>to build these up. Remember, one of the main creators of the 16 sequence,<br>Prof. Gireeja Ranade, had experience guest teaching in 70 before she came up<br>with the ideas for 16. There are many subtle linkages that might not be<br>visible to students. (And that’s fine — we just want you to get stronger. We<br>don’t need you to understand why you are getting stronger.) Strictly content<br>wise, there is a connection between polynomial material in 16B with polynomial<br>material in 70, as well as between least-squares material across 16A and 70.</p>

<h3 id="Instructor-answer-8"><a href="#Instructor-answer-8" class="headerlink" title="Instructor answer"></a>Instructor answer</h3><p>Anant: You really should take all your lower divs before taking upper divs.<br>Upper-div courses are allowed to freely assume knowledge of lower-div<br>material.</p>
<p>Elad: Following up on Anant’s point above, I would strongly recommend against<br>delaying 16A (and similarly, EE16B). These classes were not only specifically<br>developed to be of greatest impact early in your undergraduate career (i.e.,<br>as a freshman), but are targeted to help you learn how to think about problems<br>in a way that will be extremely useful/effective in many other classes<br>(including upper-divs).</p>
<p>Nicole: Additionally, It can be difficult for LSCS students to enroll in this<br>course. Delaying it to a final semester is a big risk if you’re unable to get<br>in.</p>

<p>I transferred to Cal last fall from a community college. I am an Applied Math<br>major with a focus in CS. Relevant courses I have taken are Math54, CS61AB &amp;<br>70. I plan on enrolling in EE126 in the fall because I found the probability<br>section of 70 to be quite interesting and I plan on taking CS189 next Spring.<br>I will also be taking Math 110 and Math 104 in the fall.</p>
<p>I realize 16a &amp; b are pre-reqs for 126 but I do not have extra units to use<br>for those courses. If there are some p-sets/ readings to do on information<br>relevant to 126 from 16a &amp; b, I have plenty of free time over the summer to do<br>so. Do any students of 126 or staff have resources for this endeavor? Or any<br>other suggestions for preparing for 126 without direct knowledge from 16a &amp; b?</p>
<p>Removed that paragraph since 16A &amp; B are not pre-reqs for EE126.</p>
<p>Thanks for your time.</p>

I<br>have read through several threads and have seen different responses. Either<br>people think that it is helpful for mastery, or people think it is too in<br>depth to be necessary and that the probability taught in 70 is different<br>enough that it is not worth it. Thanks for the help!</p>
<h3 id="Anant-Sahai’s-answer-43"><a href="#Anant-Sahai’s-answer-43" class="headerlink" title="Anant Sahai’s answer"></a>Anant Sahai’s answer</h3><p>The strong recommendation for CS students is to take 126 after 70 instead of<br>taking Stat 134. EECS 126 leans on 70 more and teaches you more than 134 can<br>without assuming 70. EE16A and EE16B should be sufficient mathematical<br>maturity preparation to engage successfully with 70. Seeing specific material<br>before is not generally a good strategy for preparing for a course. In the<br>absence of suitable preparation, it can be actively harmful.</p>
<p>That said, if it is a matter of helping conquer apprehension regarding<br>probability after having taken 16A and 16B (for the prerequisite mathematical<br>maturity), then sitting in on Stat 134 and doing the homeworks is fine. I<br>think that just sitting-in on courses, attending lectures and discussions, and<br>doing problems to learn without any fear at all can be helpful for people.<br>Everyone faces a different mix of challenges — for some folks, it is the<br>stress of new material in the face of a GPA-threshold that degrades<br>performance. Finding ways to overcome the stress is useful, and if that means<br>sitting-in on a course, then sit in on a course. The important thing is just<br>to not confuse things. Preparation is preparation. Stress is stress. These are<br>different things.</p>
<h3 id="Followup-39"><a href="#Followup-39" class="headerlink" title="Followup:"></a>Followup:</h3><p>Student:<br>I took philosophy 140B (deals with computability and incompleteness) as a<br>breadth class after 70 and was able to follow it well as it delved much deeper<br>into the topic. (Sometimes painfully deep :) ) From Prof Mancosu, I heard 140A<br>also delves equally deep into its topics, so I’d recommend it after 70 if<br>you’re interested. tl;dr don’t take Phil 140AB before 70 imo</p>
<p>Student:<br>Which is one of the easiest parts of CS70 imo</p>
<p>Student:<br>I haven’t taken those courses, but I believe that the overlap material between<br>the philosophy department and CS70 is only on propositional logic, which 70<br>spends a week or less on.</p>

<h3 id="Followup-40"><a href="#Followup-40" class="headerlink" title="Followup:"></a>Followup:</h3><p>Student:<br>It depends on what upper-divs you’re more interested in. If they’re ones with<br>61C as a prereq, then you may want to take 61C earlier.</p>
<p>Likewise, for interviews: it depends on what sorts of positions you’re<br>interviewing for.</p>
<p>Student:<br>I’ve found 61c is more useful for an internship</p>
<p>Student:<br>61c imo is more useful for interviews. 70 is useless for this.</p>
<p>Student:<br>I can’t think of any common interview questions that test 70 knowledge</p>
<p>Student:<br>Not really. 70 is also used more on interviews which will be useful during<br>recruiting season for internships. 61C is useful, but if you had to choose<br>between 61C and 70 first, id do 70.</p>

<h3 id="Anant-Sahai’s-answer-44"><a href="#Anant-Sahai’s-answer-44" class="headerlink" title="Anant Sahai’s answer"></a>Anant Sahai’s answer</h3><p>This sort of thing has come up repeatedly, and I think that having a faculty<br>perspective might be helpful for students.</p>
<p>I understand how tempting it is to think that it might be reasonable to<br>prepare for a course by reading up on the problems from a previous semester’s<br>offering of that course. After all, what could possibly be a better<br>preparation?</p>
<p>However, this perspective is dangerously wrong. First, reading problems and<br>solutions is generally a horrible idea. It has none of the benefits of<br>actually doing problems. Second, it has all the harms of interfering with your<br>ability to learn how to reason about something that you haven’t seen before.<br>Third, it creates opportunities for you to propagate bad form and cement<br>distortions that arise from conceptual gaps — this is because instead of<br>learning the concepts, skills, and ways of thinking that we are teaching you,<br>it is possible to simply learn how to do these particular problems. Because<br>you have no guidance or study group or any other resource that is normal<br>during the semester, there is nothing to stop this. Then, when you experience<br>the course itself, this half-bad understanding will actually seem to carry you<br>through. It is far better for you to actually experience challenge that points<br>out what you don’t understand so that you can actually understand.</p>
<p>So, what should you do if you want to be proactive and prepare ahead of taking<br>a course? First, make sure you have the prereqs. That should go without<br>saying. After that, try your hand at material that exercises the same basic<br>underlying skills but is fundamentally different. For 70, that would be doing<br>things like going through every problem in the textbook by Rosen. Or reading<br>How To Prove It by Vellemen and doing the exercises within that. This will<br>avoid interfering with the ability of the actual course 70 from helping you<br>while still giving you a strong leg up.</p>

<h3 id="Followup-47"><a href="#Followup-47" class="headerlink" title="Followup:"></a>Followup:</h3><p>Anant Sahai:<br>There are multiple reasons.</p>
<p>EE16A has a core mission to make sure that students learn how to “think<br>rigorously like engineers” (where we have a very EECSy-perspective on what<br>that means). The entire treatment of material, style of homeworks, etc. is<br>designed to allow students who take it seriously to sincerely engage with<br>conceptual and skill gaps that they have and to overcome them on this journey.<br>This is simply not one of the design objectives for Math 54.</p>
<p>EE16A takes it for granted that students live in a world that has computers in<br>it and that software tools should be used to help students connect with the<br>ideas. Practically every week, there is something that forces you to connect<br>with ideas in the course using a computer. This facilitates students being<br>able to leverage their computational intuition to help strengthen their<br>mathematical intuition. This is not something that Math 54 cares about at all<br>and so is a major lost learning opportunity, especially for a student<br>interested in CS.</p>
<p>EE16A has labs in which you get to see the linear-algebraic concepts that you<br>are learning actually pay off in an application. This allows students to<br>connect physical intuition to further strengthen and reinforce their<br>mathematical intuition. Math 54 has no labs and does not usually try to engage<br>strongly with physical intuition or vice-versa, use mathematical intuition to<br>build physical intuition.</p>
<p>EE16A is part of a two semester sequence with EE16B — so it knows that<br>students will get more deeply familiar with ideas as they are developed and<br>encountered over these two semesters. Consequently, EE16A can afford to reduce<br>the seeming coverage of certain linear-algebraic material in exchange for<br>actually deepening students core thinking skills. The circuits module in 16A<br>is really about teaching design and problem modeling and decomposition skills,<br>while also providing much deeper groundings for lots of core linear-algebraic<br>and mathematical ways of thinking. (While, yes, also teaching students about a<br>complementary perspective on what information processing is and how it engages<br>with the physical world.) Math 54 isn’t able to spend time on building those<br>mental muscles because it has other things that must be covered. By the time<br>students finish EE16B, the treatment of the material has gone beyond Math 54<br>in multiple dimensions.</p>
<p>In the end, you have to remember that certain key faculty members and several<br>of the key TAs who shaped 16A had come directly from having taught 70 before.<br>They had seen exactly the kinds of mental-muscle weaknesses that had caused<br>students to shed tears in 70. (It’s not the material in 70 that is ever the<br>real cause of student difficulty — it’s almost always thinking.) And 16AB<br>were explicitly designed to strengthen those muscles while also building<br>broader conceptual foundations for machine learning, robotics, circuit design,<br>vision, AI, etc. Math 54 wasn’t designed with any of this in mind. It serves a<br>wide variety of engineering and physical science departments and focuses on<br>teaching a set of material.</p>
<p>Can students go from Math 54 and do well in 70? Sure they can. Lots of people<br>have. Will students who went through 16AB not have to work in 70? Nope! 70 is<br>going to be work because it takes work to learn new material and internalize<br>it, along with leveling up certain ways of thinking as well. But the<br>recommended path of 16A, 16B, and then 70 is recommended for a reason.</p>

<p>IIRC, the average GPA for a lower div was recommended to be a 2.7, with a<br>distribution something like 17% A’s, 55% B’s, 20% C’s, 10% D’s, 3% F’s. And<br>the average GPA for an upper div was recommended to be a 3.0, with a<br>distribution something like 25% A’s, 60% B’s, 10% C’s, 5% D’s, 0% F’s.</p>
<p>Just curious to compare, since this is the first time the guidelines have been<br>update since 1989.</p>

<p>Elad: I don’t happen to recall the exact numbers from the previous policy, but<br>the numbers quoted in the original post sound about right. The reason for the<br>change in the average target was largely driven by more accurately reflecting<br>actual practice, and the wider range of grades than in the past was also to<br>reflect actual variability across courses/populations, as well as to allow<br>flexibility as our degree programs become more or less selective.</p>

<p>That said, you should never apply to an area within which you would not want<br>to do research.

From the perspective of a<br>student applicant, this can appear arbitrary, and to an extent, it is. After<br>all, students’ underlying research interests and inclinations tend to be broad<br>and flexible and a snapshot taken in a November application doesn’t<br>necessarily predict all that well what they really want to do the next<br>September when they start working on potential research projects. Oh well.</p>
<p>That said, you should never apply to an area within which you would not want<br>to do research. This means potentially doing research with multiple faculty<br>who associate with the area, not what you might think the area means based on<br>its name. Similarly, you should never apply to an area within which you would<br>not clearly demonstrate that you are a candidate that meets the very high<br>quality bar. (Talk to faculty in office hours if you want to get a sense for<br>what that means on an area by area basis.)</p>
<h3 id="Followup-51"><a href="#Followup-51" class="headerlink" title="Followup:"></a>Followup:</h3><p>Anant Sahai:<br>The easiest thing to do is to look at 70’s HW and exams — can you do<br>everything easily? If so, it is probably not worth worrying about the prereq<br>requirement. However, in our experience, very very few students actually have<br>70-level understanding without taking 70. (You can’t just look at the course<br>description and an abbreviated syllabus. For a lower-division course in<br>particular, there is a lot more going on in terms of maturity level and<br>perspectives than can ever be described concisely on any syllabus.)</p>
<p>Every instructor has their own perspective on how those without prereqs should<br>act. I know that mine is pretty simple. If anyone wants to take a course<br>without having had a prereq,</p>
<pre><code>1. They should agree that they will not ask questions in class or lab or discussion without having had a private conversation beforehand with the TA and/or Prof to make sure that the source of their question isn&apos;t indeed coming from a subtle or not-so-subtle gap in their background. 
2. They should further agree not to take a slot in office hours unless nobody else is waiting. For the same reason above. Piazza should be viewed as a kind of office hours in this regard. In email, they should say &quot;only answer if you have the time.&quot;
3. They should disclose this fact early to any study group that they might be considering being a part of. 
</code></pre><p>Basically, someone without the prereqs shouldn’t inadvertently cause a burden<br>on others including course staff, and should err on the side of caution in<br>this regard. On the flip side, someone who has taken the appropriate prereqs<br>should feel free to ask when they don’t understand something or wonder<br>something. It is to protect the ability of those who legitimately have<br>questions that I have this perspective.</p>
<h3 id="Followup-52"><a href="#Followup-52" class="headerlink" title="Followup:"></a>Followup:</h3><p>Student:<br>Did you have CS experience beforehand aside from 61a?</p>
<h3 id="Followup-53"><a href="#Followup-53" class="headerlink" title="Followup:"></a>Followup:</h3><p>Student:<br>I agree that 61B is the strongest prereq to 170, and I think that the only<br>compelling reason to do 170 before finishing 70 is if OP is in a rush to ace<br>those CS internship interviews.</p>
<p>Student:<br>Last semester, CS70 spent two weeks on teaching writing proofs, and then also<br>the rest of the semester on actually writing proofs. Way more than a week.</p>
<p>And for most students, they will not have encountered proof writing in other<br>courses they take before CS170. Sure, this is YMMV, but this isn’t from the<br>two classes being independent, but from students being able to learn the<br>material elsewhere; this doesn’t make 70 less of a prereq.</p>
<p>Anant Sahai:<br>Yes, the two closest points of contact between 70 and 170 are writing proofs<br>and the idea of reductions (which is hit by combinatorial proofs in 70).<br>Graphs (depending on the 70 semester) are another point of contact as is<br>modulo arithmetic. The FFT material in 170 implicitly leans on 16B. However,<br>there is no doubt that the most direct prerequisite for 170 is actually 61B<br>while the most natural follow-on course for 70 is 126. However, what most<br>people really need from 70 is the boost from sophomore mathematical and<br>problem-decomposition maturity to beginning upper-division maturity. It’s not<br>enough to be told about X in one week. You have to build the mental muscles by<br>doing it for a semester. What exactly you do to build those muscles matters<br>far less.</p>
<p>To first order, the principal educational components of the six EECS lower-<br>division courses are about building raw stamina, mathematical muscles,<br>modeling and problem-decomposition muscles, and programming/debugging muscles.<br>While also giving students exposure to key ideas, techniques, tools and<br>context along the way. For someone who has the stamina and those muscles, the<br>specific ideas, techniques, tools and context should be quite easy to acquire.<br>(e.g. at triple speed or faster. So instead of spending 20hrs/week, just 6-7<br>hrs — skip discussion and finish HW/projects in 3-4 hrs per week.) For the<br>most part, all the real challenge and time in the lower-division comes from<br>needing to strengthen the mental muscles and build up stamina.</p>
<p>Student:<br>I don’t think 70 has a monopoly on learning proof-writing techniques, and<br>proof writing techniques were at most a week’s worth of learning as I recall.<br>Again, YMMV and I know that many people including you disagree with me, but I<br>wanted to show that a differing opinion does exist.</p>
<p>Student:<br>Er, you don’t recall writing proofs in 170?</p>
<h2 id="Double-Major-logistics"><a href="#Double-Major-logistics" class="headerlink" title="Double Major logistics"></a>Double Major logistics</h2><p>2017-05-19<br>I am currently an EECS major, but am also thinking about double majoring in<br>math, as I find the subject both important and interesting. However, since<br>math is in the college of sciences, do I have to fulfill the breath<br>requirements for the college of sciences as well? Is this the same for a<br>minor?</p>
<h3 id="Anant-Sahai’s-answer-47"><a href="#Anant-Sahai’s-answer-47" class="headerlink" title="Anant Sahai’s answer"></a>Anant Sahai’s answer</h3><p>Just take the Math courses you want to take. Math courses are incredibly<br>valuable. And the Math major upper div requirements are well thought out. So<br>following those is a pretty good idea. You’ll get a great education.</p>
<p>But essentially nobody in the real world cares about whether you majored in<br>Math or double majored in Math. Not grad schools, not employers, not<br>prospective spouses, not your neighbors, nobody. Maybe there’s some discount<br>coupon somewhere, who knows. But you get the idea. Education isn’t collecting<br>badges.</p>
<h2 id="EE16A-Preparation"><a href="#EE16A-Preparation" class="headerlink" title="EE16A Preparation"></a>EE16A Preparation</h2><p>2017-05-19<br>I’m taking EE16A next semester with no experience in linear algebra or<br>circuits. What are some ways I could prepare myself for the class over the<br>summer?</p>
<h3 id="Anant-Sahai’s-answer-48"><a href="#Anant-Sahai’s-answer-48" class="headerlink" title="Anant Sahai’s answer"></a>Anant Sahai’s answer</h3><p>Understand basic calculus and know basic Python programming at the level that<br>taking 61a or DS8 concurrently would provide. EE16A is aimed at freshmen and<br>so you should never hesitate to have a conversation with a TA about your<br>preparation. The course staff understands that different folks come in with<br>different backgrounds and you’re not compared with each other. Paying<br>attention and being willing to work hard every week is what the course<br>demands.</p>
<h3 id="Followup-54"><a href="#Followup-54" class="headerlink" title="Followup:"></a>Followup:</h3><p>Student:<br>All I meant by “up against” is that you are in the same class as people who<br>might be more familiar/comfortable with the concepts. I fully agree that it<br>provides a lot of resources for you to ask questions/practice concepts/etc,<br>but if you have the time over the summer then it can still be helpful to<br>familiarize yourself with whatever section you feel might be the hardest for<br>you (LA or circuits). It’s a very time consuming class, and if you are taking<br>two other techs with it it can often be hard to find time to go to as many<br>office hours as you maybe should to achieve full comprehension.</p>
<p>Anant Sahai:<br>The grading in 16A is designed to not penalize students who come in at the<br>designed level — that is folks who have absolutely no background in linear<br>algebra besides that implied by high school math. You’re not “up against”<br>anyone in the 16 series.</p>
<p>The 16 series is designed to be inclusive in character — you are encouraged<br>to approach your TA or come to faculty office hours if you have a question<br>about background stuff. We assume you are willing to work hard and will help<br>you to do what needs to be done to patch any background holes you might have.</p>
<p>Like 61A, the main purpose of the 16 series is to get you to think about<br>things in better ways. Some of what is perceived as difficulty in 16 is just<br>the process of students learning how to think better. In some cases, having to<br>unlearn certain bad “micro-habits of thought.” Nothing in the 16 series is<br>supposed to be “tricky” in nature. However, many things are designed to help<br>students develop the mental counterparts of “good form” in<br>sports/athleticism/yoga/dance/singing/etc. Cultivating an attitude of being<br>open to learning and willing to adjust your mental form is far more helpful<br>than any specific review of any specific topic.</p>
<p>Student:<br>It assumes no knowledge yeah, but you’re still up against people who have a<br>much more solid grounding in all these things so I’d say you’re certainly at a<br>disadvantage.</p>
<p>Student:<br>EE16A assumes no knowledge of Math 54 concepts / circuits concepts. However, a<br>lot of your peers in the class will have already taken Math 54, which can make<br>it feel like you are behind during the first few weeks of the class, so maybe<br>spend a bit of time learning some Linear Algebra so you don’t feel overwhelmed<br>in the beginning weeks. The circuits section can be painful for a lot of<br>people (especially if you don’t have a background in it, like me). However,<br>there a lot of resources they provide to learn the circuits portion. If you<br>were to study one portion over the summer, I would personally say to focus on<br>the circuits portion as I found it to be the most difficult part of the class<br>(granted, I took Math 54 beforehand, so the linear algebra portion was almost<br>all review for me)</p>
<p>Student:<br>Beg to disagree. A solid foundation in the physics of circuits would have been<br>immensely helpful when I took it. The 16 series works just fine as a freshman<br>class because most freshmen come in with a solid physics background. If you’re<br>like me and came from a school weak there, I’d really recommend studying up on<br>it. Do Khan Academy if nothing else.</p>

For many students, that level<br>of probability understanding will practically require taking something like<br>126 to adequately consolidate and strengthen their understanding. 126 is the<br>recommended probability course for all EECS and LSCS students because it<br>builds on 70.</p>

<p>Student:<br>Yes it is enough, however math 110 will help. It’s all up to you! :)</p>
<p>Student:<br>Thx! So is MATH 54 enough for CS 189?</p>
<p>Student:<br>I don’t think so. EE16A and EE16B together are supposed to cover Math 54 (as<br>well as applications with linear algebra to circuitry). Math 110 is very<br>different as its more theoretical as an upper div math course.</p>

<h3 id="Anant-Sahai’s-answer-53"><a href="#Anant-Sahai’s-answer-53" class="headerlink" title="Anant Sahai’s answer"></a>Anant Sahai’s answer</h3><p>From my experience teaching 70, the issue is mathematical maturity for most<br>students, not any specific topic per se. Even mathematical maturity isn’t<br>entirely about what many of you might think of as “math” (namely something to<br>do with numbers or variables or shapes). EE16AB are designed to help build<br>this and <em>everything</em> works to help do that, while also teaching you important<br>foundations for the upper division and beyond. Specific topics in 16B do show<br>up in 70 itself, but that’s not the main benefit. The standard recommendation<br>stands: take 16ab. If you are in a rush, start with 16a and see how you feel.</p>
<p>Mathematical maturity is like athletic conditioning. Not everyone comes in at<br>the same level, but everyone can get themselves to where they need to be.</p>

<p>2017-04-30<br>Hello, I am currently an upcoming sophomore for the 2017-18 academic year that<br>is intending to major in LSCS. I am currently agonizing over whether or not to<br>just take the two remaining pre-requsites to know if I can get into the major<br>sooner, or if I am better off with the safer option of spreading out the two<br>pre-requisites over the next two semesters. I have been reading posts about<br>ee16a vs cs70 but I have not been able to relieve my anxiety over which option<br>would be the best option for me.</p>
<p>I have read that taking ee16a before cs70 would be a better option as ee16a<br>would help me build mathematical maturity that cs70 requires to be successful<br>with the fact that a lot of people stated that they found ee16a much more<br>easier than cs70 and I have more opportunity to get a better grade in cs61b<br>rather than split my focus between two very important classes. However, I have<br>also heard that cs61b with cs70 is the much more manageable option than cs61c<br>and that ee16b is much better taken right after 16a as the topics are very<br>important and that I might forget some of them if I put a semester in between.<br>Also, taking ee16a earlier than cs70 would be a waste of units if I end up not<br>getting into the major. It’s killing me. &gt;_&lt;</p>
<p>Some important facts about me: I do not have the best time-management or study<br>skills but I do put in the work and time when I need to. I believe that I am<br>between an A-/B+ in both cs61a and math 1b but those could go up to A’s if I<br>do well on finals (which I feel somewhat confident in). However, I do feel a<br>little bit weak in the math department so that could be a factor. Oh and if it<br>helps in any way, I do have an interest in computer hardware and am able to<br>build one but I do not know if that helps in cs61c or not.</p>
<p>I will be thankful for any input and feedback I can gain on which of the two<br>paths would be the most efficient one, or if I shouldn’t worry to much and<br>just let my heart be my guiding key (I’m sorry). Thank you so much for your<br>time and consideration</p>

<h3 id="Anant-Sahai’s-answer-55"><a href="#Anant-Sahai’s-answer-55" class="headerlink" title="Anant Sahai’s answer"></a>Anant Sahai’s answer</h3><p>I’d be curious to hear the instructor’s perspective <strong>@ Satish Rao</strong> <strong>@ Anant<br>Sahai</strong></p>
<p>The student answer is very good. The following strategy is the basic one that<br>works: (In order)</p>
<p>Ahead of lecture: PRINT OUT THE NOTES. Read them and use a pencil to make<br>marks on the notes. Put question marks where you don’t understand or are<br>confused. Write questions in the margins. If you are understanding, try to<br>work out the examples and proofs on a separate piece of paper after reading<br>them. Don’t copy, but just reconstruct after reading. But it’s ok if you don’t<br>understand something. This is still before lecture after all.</p>
<p>ATTEND LECTURE AND PAY ATTENTION: ask questions about the things that you<br>don’t understand. Take notes using pencil and paper in a notebook or on a pad.</p>
<p>After lecture: go back and look at the notes again. Are your question marks<br>mostly resolved? If not, spend some time re-reading and thinking about it. If<br>they are still questions, you really need to bring these questions with you to<br>discussion section.</p>
<p>PRINT OUT THE HOMEWORK. Look over the homework and ask yourself if you can do<br>each problem or at least know how to start. If possible, start in on the<br>easier problems at least. Make marks on the homework printout to indicate your<br>thoughts.</p>
<p>ATTEND DISCUSSION SECTION AND PARTICIPATE. At appropriate opportunities, ask<br>about the questions you still have regarding the notes.</p>
<p>If you have access to the online problems, do them. Make sure you understand<br>the very basics. If you get stuck somewhere, go back to the notes and read<br>them. If you are encountering a difficulty that you can’t overcome, bring this<br>to your study group later.</p>
<p>Really attempt to do the homework on your own. Spend about 3 hours solo. Try<br>each problem, but if you get stuck, concentrate on writing out potential<br>approaches that you could try, even if you are not sure they will work. Try to<br>formulate the problem mathematically and take some steps if it is not already<br>formulated in that way. If it is formulated in that way, take some steps<br>without worrying about whether these are getting you to the answer just yet.<br>You need to explore. Don’t bang your head against the wall for more than 15<br>minutes on any one problem or problem part without moving on. It is important<br>not to have any distractions: this means, no texting, no Facebook, no videos<br>playing, etc… Just concentrate on the homework.</p>
<p>Meet up with your study group for another two hours for the first group<br>attack. Explain to them where you are stuck. If you are actually not stuck,<br>but just ran out of your 3 hours, then it is fine to work solo side by side<br>for a while. Ask them for their thoughts about the problems. Share your<br>approaches and listen to them. This is the point at which you can also teach<br>each other the concepts and techniques that they have questions about.<br>Brainstorm angles of attack for a problem. Then sit and try to do them on your<br>own for a bit. Then return to a group dynamic. Set a 30 min limit for banging<br>your head on any particular problem or problem part in one go. Explain the<br>relevant parts of the notes to each other as you teach each other. It’s<br>alright to joke around with each other, but don’t use electronic distractions<br>when studying as a group.</p>
<p>Attend HW Party and continue the study group dynamic above, except now, you<br>can also ask TAs and tutors for advice. Between HW Party and a second study<br>group session, you should aim to have sketches of solution strategies for<br>every problem.</p>
<p>Go back and write up all the solutions on your own. (Again, no distractions.<br>Although in this phase, if you want to take a short break after finishing a<br>question, go ahead.) Ideally, you would write the solutions to the problems<br>without any reference to your notes from the study groups — that is, you<br>would rederive them based on your improved understanding. If you get stuck,<br>consult your notes. Then start on a fresh piece of paper without your notes<br>again for that problem. In general, spending 12 hours per homework total on<br>average (during regular Fall or Spring) is a reasonable amount. With bursts<br>that go higher if something is more challenging for you.</p>
<p>Come up with your own problems and share them with your study group.<br>Variations on existing problems is fine. Ask yourself if you can come up with<br>problems that exercise specific concepts. If you can’t come up with a problem<br>or a variation on a problem, you probably don’t understand the material as<br>well as you need to.</p>
<p>When the solutions come out, read them carefully. Once again, printing them<br>out is probably a good idea. Understand the way that the solution approached<br>the problem, even if your approach was different and also correct. After you<br>read the solutions, look over your own approach. Did you actually get it<br>right? To what extent? If you got it wrong, redo the problem without reference<br>to the solution. If you can’t do it without looking at the solution, you<br>clearly have a gap in your understanding that needs filling. You need to read<br>the solutions before starting the next homework set. Don’t put this off even<br>if the course doesn’t force it.</p>
<p>The research on education is clear: taking notes on paper/pencil is superior<br>to typing. Having the ability to spread notes out spatially on a desk or the<br>floor allows you to keep more context in your visual field — that isn’t<br>possible unless you have multiple tablets even with a tablet-based system.</p>
<p>Remember, every single thing in the lower division is something that you need<br>to master.</p>

<p>189 is not an entry level upper division course. It is an advanced level upper<br>division course. 126 and 170 are entry level upper division courses relevant<br>to the broad area. So are 127 and 120.</p>
<h3 id="Followup-60"><a href="#Followup-60" class="headerlink" title="Followup:"></a>Followup:</h3><p>Student:<br>+1 for prof maharbiz</p>
<p>Student:<br>Maharbiz is fantastic for 16B but he just covers the circuits part. The rest<br>if taught by Lustig, but I think he’s relatively new, so I don’t think many<br>people have experience with him.</p>
<p>Student:<br>The only “concept” 189 uses from 53 is the calculation of gradients; that<br>being said, 53 teaches you to think geometrically, especially in higher<br>dimensional spaces. This thinking is very useful in 189, where we visualize<br>higher-dimensional objects through their isocontours, so 53 would help a lot.</p>
<p>As for 16B, the main two things from 16B that are useful in 189 are the<br>coverage of PCA and SVD, and the ability to think of a neural network as a<br>form of a circuit. I didn’t take 16B before 189, and am not feeling too<br>uncomfortable at this point, so I’d say choose one of the two depending on<br>your strengths/weaknesses (for example, I feel weak with geometry-style<br>thinking, so I would choose 53, but this might vary from person to person).</p>
<p>One more thing - both 53 professors next semester are absolutely stellar (I<br>don’t know about the 16B profs), if that motivates you to take 53.</p>

<p>Thanks for your help and advice!</p>
<h3 id="Anant-Sahai’s-answer-60"><a href="#Anant-Sahai’s-answer-60" class="headerlink" title="Anant Sahai’s answer"></a>Anant Sahai’s answer</h3><p>I will answer this question by speaking to what the courses 16A and 16B were<br>designed to do.</p>
<p>These are courses that are designed to be taken by freshmen (both EECS and<br>LSCS-intended) who have had high school calculus and are taking the intro<br>computation series (61AB) in parallel with 16AB. To this audience, they are<br>designed to help advance their skill in thinking about information and how it<br>connects to the real world, building a solid foundation in concrete linear<br>algebra (of Euclidean n-space and complex c-space) along the way. The 16AB<br>series are designed to be modern and to be the right lower-division<br>introduction in a world that has ML as an important topic that many students<br>will engage with.</p>
<p>The circuits content in 16AB (static linear circuits in 16A and dynamic<br>circuits in 16B along with transistors as switches with parasitics) is<br>designed to do two things. First, be synergistic with the overall themes of<br>thinking (modeling, design thinking, breaking problems into smaller parts,<br>mapping things to mathematics, etc…) and linear algebra in the rest of the<br>course. There is a purely pedagogical purpose here. Second, to expose students<br>to circuits as an alternative perspective on understanding information<br>processing, with a particular focus on the interface to the real world. We<br>believe that this alternative perspective and the mental muscles it develops<br>is vital since a purely imperative or symbolic-functional perspective on<br>information processing is too limiting for a 40-year career, especially as we<br>consider how information can be processed by things like neural networks both<br>of the present and in the future.</p>
<p>The dynamical behavior perspective in 16B is also very important as we think<br>about a future of robots, etc. and the introductory treatment of control<br>theory is meant to convey some insight about how the combination of<br>information processing and a physical system can result in a new combined<br>physical systems that behaves differently. This kind of thinking, we believe,<br>is going to be increasingly vital. It is not enough to think of a robot at the<br>level of a physical system that obeys commands. Instead, we have to accept<br>that the very nature of how the robot reacts to the world is intertwined with<br>the information processing that we engineer.</p>
<p>The linear-algebraic material includes perspectives on casting problems as<br>optimizations (including linear regression and minimum energy control) and<br>detailed discussions of things like choices of coordinates, PCA (also a kind<br>of optimization perspective) and the SVD, along with an exploration of how<br>time-invariant structure in linear operators creates symmetries that can be<br>exploited in the right coordinate systems. Most of the heavier lifting is done<br>in 16B with the preliminaries introduced in 16A. The treatment of differential<br>equations in 16B is consequently also very linear-algebra centered, and<br>follows the paradigm of showing how the simple 1d case generalizes to higher<br>dimensions with eigenstructure playing the starring role.</p>
<p>The default choice is that a student takes 16A and then 16B and then 70.<br>That’s how we intend students to take these courses. The introduction of 16AB<br>in the freshman year allows upper division courses to adapt and improve<br>because they can now count on these perspectives as well as the understanding<br>that they provide. 189, for example, starting next semester will just take 16B<br>for granted.</p>
<p>What do you need for 16B from 16A? Basic linear algebra concepts and simple<br>linear circuits viewed statically.</p>

<p>Sahai: You should take 16B ahead of taking Math 110. What students don’t<br>realize is that the courses are constantly being updated. It is true that the<br>traditional form of 120 had a very slight to no dependence on the material in<br>16B. (Understandable, since 16B is the radical new course while 120 is a<br>traditional course that has existed in some form since the 1970s if not<br>earlier.) However, it is perfectly possible to conceive of a (better) form of<br>120 in which that dependence is very strong and is not just about mathematical<br>maturity or linear algebra in general, but down into the specific topics and<br>concepts taught in 16B. For example, by explicitly leveraging the finite-<br>dimensional stories in 16B as the jumping off point for the infinite-<br>dimensional stories told in 120.</p>

I do not recommend reading as preparation if that’s<br>the situation.</p>
<p>If you’re concerned, build mathematical maturity: take ee16ab (recommended) or<br>Math 53 and 54. Pay serious attention as you do and work hard. It’s up to you<br>on balancing time spent vs likelihood of success. If you enter 70 without the<br>required maturity, your likelihood of success is quite low. With the required<br>Math maturity and a willingness to work very hard and appropriate study<br>habits/process and a schedule that permits you to invest the time into the<br>course, I believe doing well in 70 is in reach for all Berkeley students.</p>

<p>Anant Sahai:<br>Already have taken EE16AB (recommended) or Math 53 and 54. It isn’t any<br>particular topic that tends to cause people serious difficulty in 70. The<br>course is pretty self contained in terms of content.</p>
<p>Before preparation, there is the issue of evaluating your mathematical<br>maturity. This is actually the weak link in anyone’s ability to give advice<br>about this. In person, it is possible to evaluate mathematical maturity. It is<br>hard for someone to accurately self-evaluate it. Can you solve problems step<br>by step without experiencing exponential drops in confidence with every step?<br>Can you model a problem mathematically without being sure how to solve the<br>resulting mathematical problem? Are you comfortable solving pieces of the<br>problem without solving the whole thing? Can you concentrate for a long period<br>of time on trying things out systematically (instead of randomly), without<br>being distracted? Can you detect that you are making progress even if you<br>haven’t reached the destination?</p>
<p>Negative indications vis-a-vis maturity: do you instinctively reach for a<br>formula to solve a problem and search for numbers to plug into that formula?<br>Does trying and getting an answer wrong or getting stuck feel really bad to<br>you like you wasted a bunch of time?</p>
<p>The work in CS70 is relatively a marathon and not a sprint. 16AB aren’t<br>marathons, but they are longer runs than sprints. It is hard to go from<br>sprints to a marathon without going through longer runs in between. At least<br>this is how it feels to students when they start. From the perspective of a<br>senior who is graduating, CS70 should feel easy.</p>

<p>I’m debating whether I should take EE16B because circuits are a major part in<br>16B. Does EE16B help with other CS classes, specifically CS and CS189? (L&amp;S CS<br>Major)</p>

In other<br>words, there’s about 4-5 weeks of “circuits” in the beginning (I use quotes<br>because this material is also used to cover differential equations and some<br>very basic signals and systems), and after that the course focuses essentially<br>entirely on material that is directly relevant to machine learning/robotics<br>(control, SVD/PCA, sampling, DFT).</p>
<h3 id="Followup-68"><a href="#Followup-68" class="headerlink" title="Followup:"></a>Followup:</h3><p>Student:<br>My only reservations about taking EE16A/B is,</p>
<p>1. I would like to take EE16A and CS70 over the summer; I have prior Math 54<br>knowledge but no indication of the summer workload.</p>
<p>2. As I’m in L&amp;S, EE16B is not a mandatory requirement. And while I am<br>interested in EE courses, I’ve talked to many EECS majors who say EE16A/B<br>turned them off from EE.</p>
<p>Elad Alon:<br>I’m not quite sure which option you were asking about whether it l’s<br>recommended or not, but the two options we recommend (in order) are:</p>
<p>(1) EE16A + EE16B</p>
<p>(2) Math 54 + EE16B</p>
<p>In terms of when to take these, I would recommend taking them as early as<br>possible. (I.e., for 16A, as soon as you have mathematical maturity at the<br>level of a 5 on the Calculus BC exam, or a semester of math at Berkeley.).<br>16A/B are designed and targeted as freshman courses that build foundational<br>knowledge for EECS topics as a whole. Postponing taking these classes in my<br>opinion is thus really missing out on an opportunity - not just to learn the<br>specific material itself, but to get early exposure to how to think about and<br>even design seemingly complex systems.</p>
<p>Student:<br>Is this recommended? I’m planning on taking CS61B/CS70 over the summer so I’m<br>trying to determine when to take EE16A or B.</p>
<p>Elad Alon:<br>This is correct; our recommended path is to take EE16A and EE16B, but you can<br>also take Math 54 and EE16B. (Currently enrolled Berkeley students are also<br>allowed to take EE16A and Math 54, but I generally wouldn’t recommend that<br>path.)</p>

Does anyone have any suggestions on the most<br>related or overlapping stats courses, or if this would be a good idea? (CS<br>intended, currently in Math 1b and 61b)</p>
<h3 id="Anant-Sahai’s-answer-69"><a href="#Anant-Sahai’s-answer-69" class="headerlink" title="Anant Sahai’s answer"></a>Anant Sahai’s answer</h3><p>What you need for 70 is mathematical maturity, not experience with<br>probability. EE16AB are enough to raise your mathematical maturity to the<br>right level. Math 1B by itself is almost certainly not enough. Taking Stat 134<br>without Math 53 is decidedly not advised, and the consensus guidance for all<br>EECS and LSCS students is to take EE126 after CS70 instead of taking Stat 134.</p>
<p>What is “mathematical maturity”? At the most basic visceral level, it is<br>comfort in solving problems step by step and maintaining confidence in your<br>work even as you take steps forward. For 70, you need comfort and familiarity<br>with doing simple proofs and derivations as well. What we observe even in 16AB<br>is that when students come in, many are so used to getting answers immediately<br>(which is what so much of high school and standardized testing have primed you<br>for) that they freeze up when faced with a problem that does not have an<br>immediately visible path to the solution. Some students do one level better,<br>in that they start trying random things but their confidence quickly<br>dissipates as they take steps that don’t land on the answer itself. Where you<br>need to be emotionally (at a minimum) for 70 coming in is to maintain<br>confidence, execute simple things correctly, be able to be precise in talking<br>about concepts, and have some intuitive sense for when progress is being made.<br>Learning mathematical maturity is sometimes kind of painful, but this is pain<br>that you must experience to progress. The way that 16AB inflict this good pain<br>upon you is forcing you to confront multistep problems that you cannot solve<br>immediately.</p>
<p>Students should not rush into 70 prematurely or they won’t be able to fully<br>benefit from how it takes their basic sophomore mathematical maturity and<br>forces them to rise to the next level (most visibly in being able to<br>appreciate and do proofs that require strategy and not just tactics) — the<br>level that you need to be at to begin to grow in the manner that courses like<br>126 and 170 want you to grow.</p>
<h3 id="Followup-70"><a href="#Followup-70" class="headerlink" title="Followup:"></a>Followup:</h3><p>Student:<br>I took (and did well in) Math 54 the semester before I took 70, that probably<br>helped me quite a bit in terms of mathematical maturity.

<p>Student:<br>^ what math courses had you taken going in? A lot of people have also talked<br>about “mathematical maturity?” Had you taken 54 prior to the course?</p>

<p>Please feel free to talk to either Prof. Elad Alon or myself (just email<br>either of us) about what made you feel that the circuits content was<br>problematic for you. The goal is to have it be synergistic with the rest of<br>the content from a thinking perspective, and so if you felt that there was a<br>gap, then either there is some bug in the way that the material was presented<br>to you or there is some particular mental muscle that hasn’t been<br>appropriately exercised yet. In particular, the circuits content in 16B is so<br>limited that it is hard to explain a lower grade purely on that basis. This<br>suggests that there is something else that is the problem. It is good to fix<br>these kinds of problems as early as possible in your undergraduate career,<br>which is one of the reasons why 16AB are intended to be taken by freshmen.</p>

<p>As someone who is in 70 and will likely be taking 189 before taking 126 or<br>another rigorous probability course, I’m wondering if you have any resources<br>that you can recommend that are helpful for practicing continuous probability,<br>sampling, estimation, and the other topics you mentioned. Would the material<br>for this be found in, say, the books used for Stat 134/135? Thanks!</p>
<p>Student:<br>(OP)<br>Hi Garrett - thank you for taking the time to answer my question! (And also<br>many thanks for creating the guide PDF)</p>
<p>I had taken note of your disclaimer on Page 1, which is why I am hoping to<br>learn from the EE/CS community what they feel are useful concepts to study<br>that may not be mentioned in the guide. I also recognize the guide serves only<br>as a introduction to some prerequisite topics; hence, I appreciate any tips on<br>resources I can use to delve further into the listed material (I’ll be sure to<br>check out the Stanford links Prof Shewchuk posted on his site).</p>
<p>I will look into the topics mentioned in your reply above. Actually feeling<br>slightly relieved, because CE 93 did teach the all topics you mentioned.<br>However it was a very straight-forward class and I’ve heard CS70 has a<br>reputation to be difficult/rigorous, which is what worried me about my<br>preparation. I’ll make sure to have Gaussian distributions, continuous<br>probability, density functions, and basic stat concepts properly reviewed and<br>under my belt by end of summer.</p>

<p>143 and 106A are both great classes as well - I think 143 is probably higher<br>time commitment than 106A, but the two classes are also pretty different (143<br>is much more lab oriented).</p>

<p>I believe that 128 has 120 as a prereq so I assume that you have already taken<br>that? 120 introduces different techniques that allow you to generalize many of<br>the concepts that you have seen in 16B in the finite-dimensional vector case<br>to the infinite-dimensional cases of signals in discrete time as well as<br>signals in continuous time. The concept of circulant matrix in 16B gets<br>replaced with the idea of an LTI system. The DFT gets generalized to the DTFT,<br>CTFT, and Fourier Series. The characteristic polynomial and eigenvalues of a<br>system matrix gets extended to think about the Laplace Transform in which the<br>poles play the roles that eigenvalues do. And so on. These ideas from 120<br>enable 128 to introduce ways of thinking about control systems that go further<br>than the taste provided in 16B.</p>
<p>Another key course for control theory is 127, optimization.</p>

<p>Anant Sahai:<br>For computational economics, there are lots of sides. Economics has had a long<br>and deep relationship to control theory (especially stochastic control theory)<br>and optimization. So, taking 126 and 127 is clearly going to strengthen the<br>appropriate muscles in a big way. The modeling aspects of probability are more<br>important than the algorithm-analysis aspects, so 126 is definitely way more<br>important than 174. Taking 170 is always good, and it is a prereq to other<br>courses that will help. It depends on what econometrics type courses you take,<br>but I think that 189 is another core EECS course that could be good for a<br>complementary perspective, but 126 and 127 are way more important.</p>
<p>You need to be taking lots of math courses though as well for preparation.<br>Math 104 is absolutely critical because you’re going to need measure theory at<br>some point (could be taken in graduate school). Economists like continuous<br>math like classic EEs and Physicists do.</p>

Would the math from 16B be enough to take on<br>courses like CS 189 and EE 221A or would it still be advisable to take 110 in<br>order to have a better math background and to do better at those courses?</p>
<h3 id="Anant-Sahai’s-answer-78"><a href="#Anant-Sahai’s-answer-78" class="headerlink" title="Anant Sahai’s answer"></a>Anant Sahai’s answer</h3><p><strong>@ Anant Sahai</strong> <strong>@ Elad Alon</strong></p>
<p>EE 16B is adequate preparation for CS 189 in the sense that the linear-<br>algebraic topics in 189 are reachable for someone who understands the material<br>in 16B. Of course, linear algebra is a deep subject that one constantly gets<br>better at, and so in 189 you are going to have to work hard. However, this<br>work is doable and you will grow as you do so, assuming you have other<br>technical maturity. (So, 189 is not intended to be taken by a 1st semester<br>sophomore by any means. 189 is a junior/senior course for real. It’s not an<br>entry-level upper-div course.) You will know more linear algebra and know it<br>better at the end of 189 than at the beginning.</p>
<p>We still recommend people to take Math 110 because the additional abstract<br>perspective is important to understand — both for cultural reasons and for<br>general mathematical maturity.</p>
<p>221A is a true graduate course. It is an entry-level graduate course, but for<br>Berkeley PhD students. This means that a well-prepared UCB senior can take the<br>course, but the intensity is quite high. A mastery of 16B is adequate<br>preparation as far as linear-algebra goes (and in fact, other students from<br>other places might have even less than that), but you really need to know more<br>material say from 120, etc. before being able to take 221A.</p>

<p>Student:<br>Prof Sahai, will your iteration of CS 189 be harder than previous iterations?</p>
<p>Anant Sahai:<br>Rigor upgrades as the curriculum improves. Linear algebra wise, 16B is<br>sufficient to start, but you will get stronger by the challenge.</p>
<p>In my view for overall technical maturity, 16a is a level 1 course, 16b is<br>level 2, 70 is level 3. 170 is level 4. 126 and 127 are also level 4, but<br>might be 4.5 in practice. I view 189 as being a level 4.5 to 5 course.</p>
<p>My opinion is that each course should appropriately challenge you and force<br>you to get sore and grow. In a nice way. You might welcome the break that<br>winter or summer brings, but in time, the understanding will stay as memories<br>of being sore fade away.</p>
<p>Student:<br>^ yea I agree with Aditya. EE 126 and 127 are much more rigorous courses than<br>189.</p>
<p>Student:<br>Currently taking CS 189 right now. I found that Math 110 and a good knowledge<br>of CS 70 probability is sufficient for CS 189. Taking EE 126 and 127 would be<br>overkill imo</p>

<p>Elad: Unfortunately I think that all of the classes listed in the student<br>response actually do require 16B. Out of the three of them, 147 is probably<br>the most likely to be OK (simply because the most relevant parts of 16B would<br>be covered in the beginning of the semester), but in general, I wouldn’t<br>recommend trying to do too much “prefetching” by taking upper divs at the same<br>time at 16B. That said, it really depends on your background - if you’d like,<br>please feel free to ping me directly and we can chat about specific<br>suggestions for you.</p>
<p>Please note BTW that 120 is continuing to evolve, and moving forward is highly<br>likely to be much more strongly leveraging the coverage in 16B.</p>

<p>Electronics has become a powerful and ubiquitous technology supporting<br>solutions to a wide range of applications in fields ranging from science,<br>engineering, healthcare, environmental monitoring, transportation, to<br>entertainment. The objective of this course is to teach students majoring in<br>these and related subjects how to use electronic devices to solve problems in<br>their areas of expertise. Through the lecture and laboratory, students gain<br>insight into the possibilities and limitations of the technology and how to<br>use electronics to help solve problems. Students learn to use electronics to<br>interact with the environment through sound, light, temperature, motion using<br>sensors and actuators, and how to use electronic computation to orchestrate<br>the interactions and exchange information wirelessly over the internet.</p>
<p>-– To add to Elad’s description above —</p>
<p>The new course is a course that is still very much in development. The goals<br>and nature of the course is very different than 16AB. 16AB are first and<br>foremost <em>freshman</em> courses intended to provide a grounding in how to think<br>systematically about systems, including both mathematical modeling and<br>connecting to/from the physical world. <em>Information</em> and in particular,<br>linear-algebraic perspectives on its nature, are at the core of the subject<br>matter in 16AB, and 16AB are intended to form a foundation upon which a great<br>deal more can be built — courses like 189, 70, 105, 120, 127, 106AB, etc….<br>While in a parallel universe, ME students could conceivably also take 16AB<br>early in their careers (as freshmen and/or sophomores) and the ME curriculum<br>could adapt to rely on the material and perspectives taught there (e.g.<br>feedback control is also a core concern in ME so the material in 16B is<br>conceptually very relevant), just taking 16A as a junior is really not a great<br>idea for serving the needs of an ME student who needs to work with mechatronic<br>systems. A service course that is aimed at being the first-and-last course<br>that someone might take in an area is very different than a foundational<br>course.</p>

The small set of topics that are covered in 134 but not in 126<br>should be easy for students to self-study after they have internalized the<br>material in 126.

<p>The courses that you seem to be gravitating towards are more on the<br>theoretical side (things building off of 16AB+70 like 170, 188, 189, 126, 127,<br>etc.). It is true that 61C in particular is the least directly connected to<br>that side of the world. However, it is very important background. Furthermore,<br>if you want to work in Industry at any point, knowledge of the material in 61C<br>is going to assumed by everyone around you. And you probably should take at<br>least one course that is more software-engineering oriented, all of which<br>depend on 61C.</p>

<h3 id="Followup-85"><a href="#Followup-85" class="headerlink" title="Followup:"></a>Followup:</h3><p>Student:<br>Thanks!</p>
<p>Student:<br>I think you should be fine. I took both 189 and I’m taking 127 right now, and<br>while 127 mentions some concepts taught in 189 such as support vector<br>machines, it doesn’t really build on top of 189 that much. You might be<br>familiar with some of the things taught in the beginning of 127 if you took<br>189 (i.e. SVD), but they’re not too difficult to learn.</p>
<p>Student:<br>Any downsides to taking 127 before 189? I wanted to take 188 before 189, so I<br>planned to do 127 alongside 188.</p>
<p>Student:<br>For the record: I’ve taken 188 and 189, and I’m currently taking 126 and 127.</p>
<p>127 vs 189? I think 127 is a harder course than 189, but remember that also<br>depends on the teacher for the course. Most people I know take 189 before<br>taking 127. (also note that 188 is largely unrelated to 126, 127, and 189.)<br>127 is more general than 189 – machine learning uses convex optimization as<br>an application.</p>
<p>127 vs 126? They are completely unrelated. 126 covers probability, 127 covers<br>convex optimization and linear algebra.</p>
<p>126 vs 134? 126 is the harder course, because it covers more topics, is more<br>accelerated, and has the sharpest cs students taking it. It is very<br>competitive. It will take a substantial amount of time. The hws are weekly and<br>take 10 hours each for me (not alone, with working with other students). if<br>you have the time, go for it.</p>
<p>I have found all of these courses to be amazing. You can’t go wrong with any.<br>Take all if you’re in the AI/ML track.</p>

I <em>do not</em> want to become a hardware engineer.<br>However, understanding the hardware is important especially for systems and<br>low-level programming - and I want to be equipped for those tasks.

<p>For example, I don’t know how computers work below the logic gate level. I<br>don’t know any hardware description language, or how to design hardware in<br>general. Is CS 150 worth taking considering I don’t want to become a hardware<br>guy? What do you suggest?</p>
<h3 id="Anant-Sahai’s-answer-86"><a href="#Anant-Sahai’s-answer-86" class="headerlink" title="Anant Sahai’s answer"></a>Anant Sahai’s answer</h3><p>First, 150 is no more. There is just 151 and 152, both of which are apparently<br>awesome courses. Back when I was an undergrad, 150 was de-facto required if<br>not actually required.</p>
<p>I’m a little confused by some of your statements though. In 16B, you should<br>have learned a little something about how logic-gates themselves work —<br>assuming the simplified transistor models presented to you. But yes, you don’t<br>know hardware description languages. Does everyone need to know that? Not<br>really. but if you want to do systems programming, then knowing 151/152 is<br>probably essential along with 149 and 162. To have a solid foundation, you<br>need to have a better grounding in the hardware than 61C alone. But 61C is<br>probably enough for someone who isn’t going to end-up in hard-core<br>performance-oriented computing.</p>
<h3 id="Followup-86"><a href="#Followup-86" class="headerlink" title="Followup:"></a>Followup:</h3><p>Anant Sahai:<br>You should have 16B and 61C before taking them. 151 is definitely not about<br>how transistors work. It is about digital design — how to design digital<br>systems (digital means that the transistors are used basically as switches)<br>with an eye to implementing them in custom hardware (whether instantiated in<br>an FPGA or in an ASIC). 152 is more focused on microprocessors specifically.</p>
<p>Talk to students in 151. They can weigh in.</p>

<p>The maturity from Math 53 is very important.

<p>Then, when I have time, I can read a NLP book like “Foundations of Statistical<br>Natural Language Processing” and understand how these concepts are applied to<br>NLP.</p>
<p><strong>Is this the best way to go?</strong> Another idea is to self-study past CS 288<br>materials.

<p>I’m currently enrolled in this class and I see little use for 2/3 of this<br>class (i.e. anything outside of linear algebra) for a majority of L&amp;S CS<br>majors who will most likely not deal with circuits in their futures.</p>
<p>I have heard the following opinions on why this is the case and provided a<br>series of counter points to them:</p>
<p>1) EE16A and EE 16B prepare students for other CS courses, specifically CS 70</p>
<p>A broad majority of L&amp;S CS majors don’t end up taking EE 16A nor EE 16B before<br>they are able to declare, since it would be useless to most of them if they<br>weren’t able to get into the major. Therefore, since CS 70 is part of our<br>declaration requirement, we anyways end up taking it before EE 16A and EE 16B,<br>which makes it useless. In regards to prepping us for other courses, a<br>majority of CS upper division courses either don’t require any knowledge of<br>circuits or require a knowledge of circuits that runs tangential to the course<br>material. This can be seen from the fact that 16a and 16b are very sparsely,<br>if at all, listed as prerequisites to any CS upper division course.</p>
<p>2) A basic amount of knowledge of circuits is essential to a proper CS<br>education.</p>
<p>I disagree with this entirely. There definitely do exist fields within CS for<br>which a knowledge of circuits would be useful but there also exists numerous<br>fields in CS (esp. with industrial application) that require absolutely no<br>knowledge of circuits. And if this is the case, it seems that imposing a<br>requirement that ALL students must know a basic amount of knowledge on<br>circuits would be unfair to those who have no need to use it in the future.<br>This is the same point that I would make as to why CS 170 and CS 162 are not<br>required for all CS majors, even though they are extremely useful in a large<br>proportion of fields within CS.</p>
<p>3) EE 16A gives students a better understanding of linear algebra that Math 54<br>that would be essential for CS majors when taking classes in the future</p>
<p>If this is a concern, students should be offered the option of taking Math 54</p>
<ul>
<li>Math 110 instead of Math 54 + EE 16A since Math 110 also imposes a higher<br>understanding of linear algebra.</li>
</ul>
<p>I argue that EE 16A should either be entirely removed as a L&amp;S CS major<br>requirement or, as mentioned in my last point, should be<br>replaced/substitutable with Math 110.</p>
<p>I would love to hear any followup discussions regarding this topic; my goal in<br>posting this is to spark a discussion on why exactly we have this requirement<br>for L&amp;S CS majors and hopefully either get it removed for future L&amp;S CS majors<br>or hear a solid explanation as to why EE 16A needs to be a requirement for all<br>L&amp;S CS majors as opposed to an optional class that L&amp;S CS majors could take if<br>their academic interests align with material taught in the class.</p>

<p>Anant Sahai:</p>
<p>Hi, I will write a more detailed answer later but first will say that I<br>encourage you to come and talk to me to understand this better. 16AB were<br>designed to be fundamental to the needs of all of our students in preparation<br>for a 40-year career going forward, and L&amp;S CS students in particular. We in<br>the faculty have a bit more experience than you do about both how fields are<br>evolving intellectually as well as just how much things can change with time.<br>As a student, you don’t really understand the bigger picture, especially the<br>scope of change and the need for a robust development of different ways of<br>thinking. Which is to be expected — otherwise, you wouldn’t need the<br>university and could just go and read books and do projects on your own to<br>learn. The answer so far (I have to go to a meeting) is basically of the<br>“trust us” variety, and there is a strong case that such trust is actually<br>fundamental to the student/teacher relationship. Everything we say will always<br>have a dimension of “trust us” to it, because you do not understand or<br>appreciate what you cannot yet fathom. In the words of Donald Rumsfeld, it’s<br>the unknown unknowns that get you. One of our goals is to make you more ready<br>for them.</p>
<h3 id="Followup-92"><a href="#Followup-92" class="headerlink" title="Followup:"></a>Followup:</h3><p>Elad Alon:<br>I guess that Anant’s and my responses crossed each other, but fortunately, (I<br>think :) we emphasized the same fundamental idea (about the importance of<br>linear algebra) while covering some other orthogonal points. Just to re-<br>emphasize though, I have no doubt that there are things that can be improved<br>in both 16A and 16B, so I’d like to make the same offer as Anant did. If<br>something doesn’t seem to be working in either of those classes, please feel<br>free to email me as well - a huge amount of thinking and work has gone in to<br>these courses, but that doesn’t mean that there aren’t still improvements to<br>be made. Constructive feedback is hence always highly welcomed.</p>
<p>Elad Alon:<br>Responding to both of your follow-ups here, approximately in order, although<br>in many ways your questions/comments are related.</p>
<p>Would I argue that any possible introduction to EE must by definition include<br>linear algebra? No, certainly not - this wasn’t the way I learned things<br>originally, and this isn’t how things are taught in most other schools (at<br>least not yet). That’s a pretty weak criteria though - as a student, I<br>distinctly remember wondering to myself why in the world I was learning the<br>things that I was (especially in my intro circuits class, but even well after<br>that), and I perservered despite that.</p>
<p>This leads to one of the main reasons I would however argue that including<br>linear algebra in an intro EE(CS) class is absolutely important - and perhaps<br>even almost necessary. Including linear algebra allows us to show with<br>relatively little prior background just how powerful the tools and techniques<br>that underly modern EE (and CS) really are in enabling real-world applications<br>that students (particularly freshman) will not only recognize, but have a<br>visceral feeling about/interest in. I really can’t take the credit for that<br>particular realization BTW - it was really much more the product of Gireeja<br>Ranade’s and Anant’s thinking than my own (at the time) - but having now<br>worked this through (along with the two of them and many others), linear<br>algebra really is the one conceptual area I can think of that finds<br>substantial importance and use across pretty much the entire spectrum of EE<br>endeavors (including the more physicsy side, as you mentioned). As already<br>mentioned, it is also something that can be taught to students coming out of<br>high school (of course with appropriate math maturity) while simultaneously<br>exposing them to the application (and hence making them feel “empowered”).</p>
<p>I certainly agree with you that an integrated approach to teaching physics 7B<br>like material would be extremely worthwhile as well. Physics 7B itself however<br>requires more math background than what can be expected from incoming<br>freshman, and so this is one of the reasons why we made the choice to<br>partition things the way we did. (Another reason for this is that for better<br>or for worse, in general, students entering from high school tend to have less<br>background in or opportunities to learn physics than they do math.)</p>
<p>I’m now dipping into a much more highly speculative topic, but to follow up a<br>bit further on your point about an integrated approach to Physics 7B, there<br>have actually been some discussions amongst the faculty about creating a “16C”<br>(naming along with everything else TBD) that could serve as an alternative<br>option for Physics 7B. This (currently hypothetical) course would more<br>directly expose students to the applications/motivations for the 7B material,<br>as well as more generally the “physicy” side of EECS. This class could then<br>also leverage the linear algebra (as well as of course circuits and basic<br>sensor ideas) from 16A/B. In case it wasn’t obvious from how I started this<br>paragraph, it isn’t at all yet clear when or even if this will happen - the<br>discussions are still highly preliminary. Based on my experience from 16A/B,<br>standing up a course like this will take (tens of) thousands of hours of work,<br>and so it’s not a task that anyone will be taking on lightly. I do believe<br>it’s an exciting possibility however, and am doing what I can to help support<br>this eventually happening (but again, absolutely no guarantees at all at this<br>time).</p>
<p>Anant Sahai:<br>Please come and talk with me about any concerns that you have about 16A. It is<br>meant to be taken by freshmen in their first semester in parallel with 61A.<br>That is firmly the intended audience and recommended scheduling by students,<br>and the course is designed for that. Clearing the backlog of students during<br>the transition who have not taken it as freshmen creates some degrees of<br>mismatch here and there, but it is our goal that even those students should<br>get a lot out of taking 16A. (I’ll be honest, when I taught it, both me and my<br>TAs got a lot out of it. And we all supposedly know all this stuff perfectly<br>by comparison — so it should reward contemplation for pretty much everyone.)</p>
<p>Our goals for 16A are to asymptotically achieve perfection in the course —<br>and this means that we welcome any and all bug reports. Send me an email. The<br>goal is that the course should be fundamentally inclusive and that every<br>single concept taught in the course should be clear, integrated, and obviously<br>relevant. Just like students, we Profs will fall short of the high goals that<br>we set for ourselves, but that doesn’t mean that we stop trying. :-)</p>
<p>In terms of linear algebra, yes, we believe that linear algebra is absolutely<br>fundamental to EECS and that students need to learn <em>why</em> things are defined<br>the way they are and to really understand the connections between these<br>fundamental concepts. This isn’t about symbol pushing or some calculating<br>tricks.</p>
<p>Student:<br>Also, to discuss your middle two paragraphs, I believe it is possible to teach<br>circuitry in your integrated fashion while still including (at least basic)<br>material on electric and magnetic fields and forces as taught in Physics 7B.<br>In fact, I think this will extend the integration to one more level, in the<br>sense of understanding how the different electrical components work under the<br>hood (in terms of how they move electrons and affect electromagnetic fields).</p>
<p>Student:<br>So to clarify, you believe it is absolutely important and necessary to include<br>Linear Algebra in any incarnation of an introductory EE course?</p>
<p>Elad Alon:<br>I do appreciate your concrete suggestion and for starting a constructive<br>dialog - I hope that my following comments/discussion will be read in that<br>spirit as well.</p>
<p>I have to admit that I’m somewhat puzzled by your comments regarding the<br>content/structure of 16A (especially relative to the recent offerings), but<br>it’s probably not worth dwelling on that. More importantly, there are a number<br>of additional (in my opinion substabtial) issues with your proposal, one of<br>the most important of which (again, in my opinion) is that this approach will<br>explicitly de-emphasize that designing efficient systems involves optimizing<br>(and hence understanding) across multiple (all) layers of hierarchy<br>simultaneously, and that often times, things you do at one level can make your<br>life dramatically simpler (or harder) at the others. The silo’ed approach you<br>are proposing is exactly what I have seen over and over in my career (both in<br>academic and industrial contexts) lead people down highly sub-optimal<br>approaches to solving the problems that faced them. For almost all intents and<br>purposes, this would go back to the 20/40 model we had before (although<br>granted it would be a very different version of 20), which was very clearly<br>not working (both overall and specifically in highlighting the above).</p>
<p>As I tried to describe in my response above, learning about how to design<br>circuits - and especially the way we present that in 16 - is really not some<br>fundamentally different beast than learning how to apply mathematical<br>techniques to solve problems in other domains (such as machine learning,<br>robotics, medical systems, …). Making this intellectual link clear<br>throughout all of the modules (in 16A and 16B) is something we are constantly<br>striving to improve, but splitting the content up (as you proposed) in to<br>separate courses certainly won’t help with this.</p>
<p>Also, as a fully practical matter, 16B (which follows the same integrated<br>approach described in the first paragraph) really wouldn’t work in the general<br>case for the target audience without the build-up and introduction (both in<br>terms of content as well as way of thinking) from 16A. While we are allowing<br>L&amp;S students moving forward (for now) to fullfil their requirements with Math<br>54 and 16B (mostly for reasons that I hope will be transient, as I’ll explain<br>below), that is not the path we recommend by any means, and is not something<br>that would work in general without the existence of 16A.</p>
<p>To clarify the above and address an indirect point I believe you are raising,<br>we are currently in discussions with both Math and Statistics about getting<br>them to accept the combination of 16A+B as replacements for Math 54 (both in<br>terms of course prereqs as well as for their majors). This is by no means a<br>done deal and we can’t yet make any guarantees, but my hope is that this will<br>address some of the practical issues that are driving some students to delay<br>taking 16 (which again, I definitely don’t recommend).</p>
<p>Student:<br>In my honest opinion, I agree with Sahai about EE 16B being a vital<br>introduction to electrical engineering, but from what I know, EE 16A just<br>doesn’t have the same quality, and seems more like a mishmash of linear<br>algebra (which is mostly covered in Math 54), and circuitry (which is already<br>somewhat, if not mostly, covered in Physics 7B). I propose the following as an<br>alternative setup:</p>
<p>Introducing a CS 70-Math 55 (as in “Linear Algebra with Emphasis in Theory and<br>Applications in Computation”) analogue for Math 54, carrying over all the<br>properties of the relationship between CS 70 and Math 55 (e.g. acceptability<br>for Math/CS double major, major requirement for CS and EECS, etc.),</p>
<p>replacing the Physics 7B major requirement for EECS with a new<br>“Electromagnetism and its Applications for Computation” class required for<br>both L&amp;S and EECS graduation, which will in teach op-amps and the remainder of<br>circuitry in 16A not already covered in lieu of most (or all) of the<br>thermodynamics unit,</p>
<p>phasing out EE 16A,</p>
<p>and keeping EE 16B as is.  </p>
<p>In this scenario, the unit requirement for EECS students will drop, and that<br>of L&amp;S CS students will stay the same (as they are not required to take<br>Physics currently, resulting in the new E&amp;M class replacing the units vacated<br>by 16A).</p>
<p>The only drawback I see in this arrangement is the possible slight increase in<br>faculty for the [EE]CS department, but I think the benefit of reducing and/or<br>streamlining the courseload would outweigh this cost.</p>
<p>Elad Alon:<br>I think that Anant largely hit the points that I would have made, but I’d like<br>to also offer to speak with anyone in person about why I believe the material<br>in EE16A and EE16B are indeed fundamental to your education as a CS student.</p>
<p>To follow up on one specific aspect that Anant hinted at however, if you look<br>at where the major innovations/advancements have happened in the last decade<br>(starting arbitrarily from e.g. the iPhons), almost all of them have involved<br>optimization and co-design among multiple levels of the system stack (from<br>applications and algorithms all the way down to the circuits and devices).<br>Even if you end up as a purely “software” engineer, our goal at Berkeley is to<br>try train you to be one of the ninjas who has at least a basic understanding<br>of how issues at layers both above and below where you work can not only<br>influence what you are doing, but provide opportunities for optimization of<br>the system as a whole.</p>
<p>Another point I’d like to make is that many of the skills you exercise in<br>circuit design are actually essentially identical to skills you would exercise<br>in software or system design as a whole (as well in linear algebra). I can<br>dive in to the details if you’d like, but debugging, modularity, modeling, and<br>using structured methods to do design and even analysis are all common across<br>the board. As a final note, there are actually many mathematical concepts<br>underlying circuits, and gaining intuition about those same concepts but with<br>physical quantities you may not be as familiar with is a great way to make<br>sure you really understand the math.</p>
<p>Anant Sahai:<br>Very coarsely speaking, there are three major ways that information is<br>processed and information processing is itself understood, and their relative<br>importance changes with time and application.</p>
<p>1) Procedure-orientation: this is the standard Turing/Von-Neumann<br>“computation” approach that is represented by most programming languages used<br>today.</p>
<p>2) Circuit-orientation: this is what is behind the operation of neural<br>networks as well as analog circuitry.</p>
<p>3) Optimization-orientation: these are where minimalist principles and<br>constraints are important. Many databases also fall into this category.</p>
<p>It is absolutely vital for a CS student to know and be comfortable with<br>reasoning about all three modes. The 61ABC series is heavily weighted towards<br>(1) with a little bit of (3) mixed in during 61A. 16AB bring more of (2) and<br>(3) into the mix, and it is vital that this happen as early as possible in<br>students’ development so that their mental muscles are more balanced in their<br>development. This is why we absolutely urge 16AB to be taken by freshmen.</p>
<p>Within (2), there are many aspects to analog information processing. In 16A<br>you see a little bit as well as how it connects via constraints to<br>optimization-oriented thinking. However, in 16B the dynamic aspects also come<br>into play. While today’s deep neural networks tend to use circuits for<br>information processing (circuits emulated by programs running SIMD cores for<br>now, but more specialized cores in the future) in a way that doesn’t involve<br>time, there is every indication that biological neural networks do indeed<br>invoke time dynamics in nontrivial ways. So it would be absolutely<br>irresponsible of us to not give students some inclination of time-dynamic<br>behavior of circuits as a part of their foundational training for a 40 year<br>career. This is why the department wants everyone taking 16A and 16B.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, EECS has two pillars: information and computation. All students<br>need grounding in both even if they may choose to specialize in one more than<br>the other. But they need to start with mental balance to the extent possible<br>so that they don’t misunderstand informational issues as being computational<br>nor vice-versa. You’re going to have to learn and adapt. It’s our job to give<br>you the foundation so that you can do so.</p>

<p>I was planning on using the green form to either P/NP or drop the course.

<p>Also, in case this information is useful, if I do end up going to grad school<br>I want to focus more on systems (and I’ve been doing pretty well in systems<br>classes over here). The class I’m having trouble in is a theory-heavy course.</p>

<p>Student:<br>No I just don’t know much about 61c. I thought it was just areas that are<br>abstracted away from programmers and that what you mostly focus on is binary<br>and stuff and didn’t know programmers can use these things to make more<br>efficient code. I also didn’t know we learn C</p>
<p>Student:<br>OP’s tone comes off as “when am I ever going to use CS 61C?” The answer is:<br>maybe never, especially if you do say front end web development or even most<br>types of software development. That doesn’t make it irrelevant.</p>
<p>Student:<br>Who’s upset? No one here has indicated being upset by anything. The OP was<br>simply asking how cs61c is useful for programming..</p>
<p>Student:<br>Well if you come expecting to learn computer programming, you can hardly be<br>upset when a computer science department teaches computer science.</p>
<p>Student:<br>“ <strong>Computer science</strong> is theoretical, it takes a scientific and mathematical<br>approach to information and it ‘s computation. <strong>Computer programming</strong> is<br>practical, it is the process of designing, writing, testing, debugging, and<br>maintaining the source code of <strong>computer</strong> programs. They are different, but<br>related fields. “</p>

<p>Student:<br>Sorry this might be a stupid question but what’s the difference?</p>
<p>Student:<br>Then again, we shouldn’t imply that studying programming is inferior. Not<br>everybody comes to Berkeley CS to someday becomes a “computer scientist”. Some<br>people come to simply be well-versed and excellent programmers in the future,<br>and there is absolutely nothing wrong with having that goal in mind.</p>
<p>Student:<br>It is still a valuable comment, to point out that there is a difference<br>between learning programming and learning computer science. 61C is needed for<br>a healthy understanding of computer science.</p>
<p>I’d guess that someone could get away with programming without 61C knowledge<br>(though even then, we do learn and use C in 61C).</p>
<p>Student:<br>Why does this matter? CS61C can still have relevance to just programming,<br>which is what OP asked about.</p>

Although not all of the<br>lectures are online, the professor does upload a rough outline of what he<br>intends to talk about in class, basically in a txt file containing the<br>pertinent questions he wants the class to talk about.  </p>
<p>In the cases where the lecture videos aren’t available, I’ve often found<br>myself confused by the questions listed, and wonder how and why the professor<br>seems to be able to pick up on minute details/edge cases and is able to ask<br>compelling questions to ask about a given paper, or a new idea.(i.e. why do<br>writes become much faster than reads according to figure 4c).

My circumstances right now:</p>
<p>- I am a first-year transfer majoring in EECS</p>
<p>- This is my second semester and I have taken or am taking CS61A, B, and C,<br>70, and EE16A</p>
<p>- I am a full-time student also working two part-time jobs and the ocassional<br>freelance work</p>
<p>- I am from a <em>very</em> low-income family and I am the main source of income</p>
<p>My source of stress and the reason why I am considering this at all is because<br>of the last point listed above. I currently receive full financial aid for my<br>classes (besides the summer semester, for some reason) and the extra money I<br>get from grants/loans along with the money from working is crucial to my<br>family’s survival. Forgive me if it sounds like I’m dramatizing that, but I<br>can’t really think of a better way to put it.</p>
<p>This May, I will not have enough money to support my family lest we resort to<br>living in a shelter or cramped apartment. Even then, we would not have enough<br>money for a lot of the necessities we pay for every month. The only options I<br>can think of are to drop out/take a semester off or attend school part-time,<br>all in order to have time for a full-time job as a software engineer. I<br>believe I have the necessary experience and side projects already for landing<br>such a job, but naturally I’m afraid to just drop out. The problem with taking<br>a semester off or attending part-time is that, since I’m a transfer in the<br>engineering department, I believe I only have a limited number of semesters<br>here before I can no longer enroll. I suppose I could petition to stay longer<br>as another option, though.</p>
<p>In summary, I’m considering dropping out to support my family before we go<br>homeless. If I have the experience and confidence in my skills to land a<br>software engineering job right now, should I go for it? Some clarification for<br>how long an EECS transfer can attend would also be appreciated.</p>

<p>We may only be sounding boards, but we are happy to do so.</p>
<p>-—-</p>
<p>I think this has already been addressed with this specific student, but since<br>it stirred a lot of conversation, I thought I’d clarify for anyone else<br>curious. Typically, UC Berkeley allows any student to leave for as much time<br>as they need. There’s a process to take time off, and some paperwork to come<br>back. The time away does not count towards your 4 years (2.5 for a transfer).<br>However, this may not be the case if you study at another institution while<br>you’re away.</p>
<p>It’s pretty common for students to “withdraw”, it’s just not something we hear<br>alot about. While Cal isn’t always great at supporting and embracing any sort<br>of “non-traditional student”, it really does allow alot of flexibility for<br>taking time off. The Advisers in your department or college are happy to talk<br>more about if if you need.</p>

My decision to open these credit cards were carefully planned<br>and I had written up a detailed plan on how I was going to manage the money.<br>If done haphazardly, credit cards could be cause more problems than it solves.</p>
<p>Student:<br>(I’m the author of the initial response thread). By going into debt, I mean<br>using it to make ends meet while you work towards graduating. My situation was<br>probably different from yours in that I had built up a credit score and was<br>eligible to apply for credit cards that gave 0% interest for 15-21 months.<br>This allowed me to get access to about $20k in 0% interest (of course, I<br>didn’t use it all but it was something useful to have to pay for important<br>expenses that financial aid didn’t cover). Having a full time job also helped<br>my chances of getting a credit card.</p>
<p>One plan that could work for you is taking one year off of school to work as a<br>software developer. Then while you’re there, save enough to help you get<br>through for the next two years. And perhaps, if your credit score is okay,<br>then you could even get 0% interest credit cards. With 15-21 months of no<br>interest (Citi Simplicity; Chase Slate; Discover 18 months), you will be able<br>to focus on school while also being able to survive. Then you will have only<br>paid a few months of interest before you get a job hopefully making a decent<br>salary.</p>
<p>Oh, I think i’m writing in circles, but I hope this clarified things without<br>making things more confusing. Feel free to ask more questions.</p>
<p>Student:<br>Thank you for sharing this. Could you clarify what you mean by going into<br>debt? I’m already taking out federal loans and, aside from borrowing from<br>people I personally know, I don’t see how private loans would have 0%<br>interest. My initial plan was to rely on my federal grants/loans and I was<br>fairly confident I could land a decent job right after graduating to pay them<br>off asap, but my circumstances have changed such that I now would need to take<br>out more loans to go down that same route (something I consider riskier than<br>just trying to find a job now and finishing school later).</p>

<p>I attempted to take CS70 this semester, but after getting around 1 standard<br>deviation below the mean on the midterm I decided to drop the course. What’s<br>troubling is I dedicated a huge amount of time to 70, understood and got high<br>grades on the homework, read the notes carefully many times, went to lecture,<br>watched lecture webcasts, went to 4 discussions a week, looked at all the<br>extra resources, and did past exams.</p>
<p>I currently have a 4.0 GPA (already took 61A and B), so I could have declared<br>if I stuck with it, but I felt too shaky with the concepts to continue. I am<br>well aware I do not have mathematical maturity required for the class, and it<br>doesn’t help that I am a freshman who wasn’t ever good at math and has not<br>taken any math courses at Cal yet. However, some such freshmen I know passed<br>the course easily (even some who came in with at most AB calculus math<br>experience). I don’t think I’m ready to take Math54 either. I’m just horrible<br>at math.</p>
<p>My plan would be taking the course this summer, while self studying 70<br>material and other math material this semester before the summer starts. I<br>only have 13 units so I would have some time to self study. What would people<br>recommend? Will it be any easier in the summer if I only take CS70? Is there<br>going to be a CSM section for summer? If not, would that negatively impact me?<br>I don’t want to get an A, I just want to get something that is not a C or<br>lower like I would’ve gotten if I continued in the course. Thank you in<br>advance!</p>
<h3 id="Satish-Rao’s-answer-2"><a href="#Satish-Rao’s-answer-2" class="headerlink" title="Satish Rao’s answer"></a>Satish Rao’s answer</h3><p>If you feel like you are horrible at math, then this is a real warning sign<br>for 70. Self-studying is a very hard way to build mathematical maturity.<br>Classes are better for that. You need to take something that will take you<br>from where you are, and improve your mathematical maturity. EE16A might help<br>you in that direction (assuming you have already done the equivalents of Math<br>1A and 1B). As freshman-oriented courses, they are more gentle with their<br>slope of mathematical difficulty.</p>
<p>The math in CS70 is not some magic or esoterica. It is accessible to everyone,<br>provided that you train for it. (Think of it like being able to run 3 miles.<br>That is something that most humans can do, even if some people might be really<br>out of shape when they start. They just have to train for longer and at a pace<br>that will let their body adapt to the rising difficulty.) Without talking to<br>you, what you described sounds like someone who was stymied by the difficulty<br>slope in 70 relative to your mathematical equivalent of athletic conditioning.<br>Take EE16A and 16B first. Then the slope in 70 should be more accessible.<br>There’s no getting around working hard, but you have clearly shown that you<br>are willing to do that.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>
<p>-————————————————————————————————————————————————–</p>
<p>Hello OP,</p>
<p>I am the current professor of CS70. Moreover, I interacted with you a bit on<br>piazza. Let me first say, I am sorry to see that you have gone.</p>
<p>I am a Dad for what its worth to kids roughly your age. So, I will give a<br>“Dad” story to hopefully address your question. My kids embark on eye-rolling<br>at this point, please feel free to do so.</p>
<p>I was in a seminar once where Terry Tao was speaking. He was a prodigy and now<br>is an incredibly accomplished and also incredibly generous mathematician<br>through his blog. He was describing at a fairly high level his work with Green<br>regarding arithmetic progressions. He was writing fairly quickly on the board,<br>but then stopped, for a while, thirty seconds perhaps even a minute. He<br>concentrated, perhaps even rocked slightly. He then nodded, perhaps remarked<br>something like “OK”, and continued his explanation.</p>
<p>What was he doing?</p>
<p>Who knows?</p>
<p>But I will speculate. He was perhaps thinking about his explanation and how it<br>fit in with the details of the proof of this epic theorem. To maintain<br>integrity, the explanation had to be faithful to the actual proof, he could<br>not go on without ensuring that. Moreover, he focused enough to get the<br>details sorted in his mind and confirm that his explanation was indeed on<br>solid ground. He did this in front of an audience that patiently awaited.</p>
<p>This focus and integrity is perhaps a view of what math is, and what doing it<br>takes. He wasn’t comfortable with communicating much less having a soft<br>understanding of what was going on, he had to ensure that what he understood<br>and communicated was true. Certainly, many details were not there, but a plan<br>whose parts could actually be executed was laid out. Second, he was able to<br>focus and bring these things together in those moments, in front of an<br>audience. The combination of the desire to communicate accurately and the<br>ability to focus to gather what context he needed into his mind to verify his<br>explanation was amazing.</p>
<p>In CS70, one needs to do this on some level. For example, think about a proof<br>of Fermat’s theorem; or $$a^{p-1} = 1 \pmod{p}$$ for non-zero $$a$$. Here, one<br>needs to gather some ideas. Any non-zero $$a$$ has an inverse $$\pmod p$$, as<br>$$gcd(a,p)=1$$ when $$p$$ is prime. Thus, we can say that the set<br>$$\{a,2a,3a,\ldots,(p-1)a\}$$ consists of distint elements and thus must be<br>the same set as $$\{1,\ldots,(p-1)\}$$ modulo $$p$$. Then, we proceed by<br>noting the product of the elements of the “two” sets are the same, but have<br>different form. From here, can you finish?</p>
<p>In some sense, this isn’t even enough to just know the basic proofs. We then<br>ask questions like show that $$a^{(p-1)(q-1)} = 1 \mod{pq}$$ on the exam!<br>Here, the proof is the same, one needs to work with the set $$\{x<br>\in\{1,\ldots pq-1\} | gcd(x,pq) = 1\}$$ as they have inverses and do a bit<br>more work. Oh my! But this is fine. You can do it! Just play with the ideas, a<br>little bijection, a little bit about inverses. Turn over the proof a couple of<br>times to see how it works. Teach someone the proof to see if you have it. But<br>do try to have it completely, if not then, eventually. Indeed, I sometimes sit<br>up in the middle of the night because I got some aspect of some explanation<br>wrong to some student.</p>
<p>One thing though that makes this very difficult, would be doing all this while<br>thinking about how “not good” at math one is. One needs to use your<br>significant mental resources to play with the ideas not to engage in fear or<br>self doubt.</p>
<p>I should note even Terry Tao had doubts at times; indeed, he was once led out<br>of an exam room in tears. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/26/magazine/the-singular-mind-of-terry-
tao.html?_r=0" target="_blank" rel="external">See<br>here.</a></p>
<p>Given your performance in 61A and 61B, these ideas are easily within your<br>grasp. Just approach them calmly, and engage, you will do fine. You are<br>welcome to continue to come to office hours and at least listen. The<br>interactions among students, and between students and TA’s may well be more<br>fun and instructive now that the pressure is off. Choose ideas to really get<br>and ensure you get them. Better to solidly have some than sketchily have many.<br>It should be fun, even.</p>
<p>TL;DR. For math, one should try to own the why. Focus on that, leave out<br>yourself and specifically doubts about yourself, however hard that is. Some<br>days we just don’t get it, that’s fine too. There is always another day.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>

<p>And the timing of the latest homework WRT to the midterm is really beneficial<br>to letting us study more breadth/speed for the exam, so I know many of us also<br>appreciate that decision by the instructors.</p>
<p>Satish Rao:<br>Sorry about the length of the homeworks. We did try to ease up a bit between<br>the midterms, with a bit of a ramp.</p>
<p>For this midterm the homework is not due for a week after the midterm, so you<br>will have more time to focus on</p>
<p>preparing for the tests.</p>
<p>The strategy on the midterms is to give more smaller problems. This is for a<br>few reasons, first is that more questions</p>
<p>increases the amount of data from which to “measure” a students knowledge and<br>ability to work with the materials, another</p>
<p>being that a “large” question like what you see on homework is problematic in<br>that the piecing together of various concepts</p>
<p>at that level is too much to expect on an exam and very noisy in that even for<br>the same student on some days</p>
<p>the insight comes quickly on another it just doesn’t. We do try to design them<br>to capture the pieces of the</p>
<p>puzzles that you put together in the homeworks. For example, testing the proof<br>of Fermat’s theorem may unwind</p>
<p>into smaller questions about inverses, bijections, and reorganizing terms<br>within a modular arithmetic framework.</p>
<p>The idea is that you worked with all of these pieces in your homework, so the<br>time spent on your homework</p>
<p>should be helpful for exam. Still, the pacing for homework is truly very<br>different than what we can test</p>
<p>on the exam; read problems, digest, play with the ideas, be creative, etc.<br>Measuring student performance fairly is a difficult</p>
<p>problem that Professors constantly struggle with.</p>
<p>As for advice, perhaps the above context is useful. In some sense, knowing the<br>design principles around the exams</p>
<p>may well help you better understand how to approach the exam.</p>
<p>Studying old exams is good. Other instructor exams are great for content, but<br>maybe to attune to my style use my</p>
<p>exams perhaps later in your studying cycle. Discussions have more smaller idea<br>problems that are akin to exams.</p>
<p>Study those. Finally, do at least understand the solutions to homeworks. We do<br>have difficult homeworks in that it</p>
<p>is difficult to come up with the solutions, but often the solutions are short<br>(annoyingly so, I would imagine) so do at</p>
<p>least try to scan over and understand the solutions to the homeworks; I<br>wouldn’t try to come up with them again</p>
<p>necessarily though as that would likely take a lot of time.</p>

<p>-———-</p>
<p>[Anant Sahai’s opinion]</p>
<p>The point of the classes that EECS offers is to, collectively, help you become<br>a better engineer (and scholar, should you go on for graduate study) over the<br>course of a 40+ year career. Ideally, a Berkeley style engineer who can work<br>on things that push the boundaries and not just filling in the blanks.<br>Engineers who can contribute to make society better and advancing the state of<br>knowledge, while learning. How classes do this is by helping you think about<br>things more clearly. When I was an undergraduate, there were things said in<br>lecture that were never on an exam or a HW that still ended up helping me<br>years later. If a student thinks that a class is about doing well on the<br>homework or on exams or getting a good grade, the student is missing the<br>point. If the student thinks the point of the course is to teach them a<br>particular tool that they can use in industry, they are also missing the<br>point. They should be paying attention and trying to internalize how we are<br>thinking.</p>
<p>A Bachelor’s degree is meant to prepare you for being an apprentice — to<br>learn productively from masters who are working in the field. There are going<br>to be many practical skills associated with both software engineering in<br>general as well as particular application domains that you will have to learn<br>in the field. In general, the time at Berkeley is precious and what you could<br>learn better in industry should be left to be taught to you there. Details<br>(and particular tools) are easy to learn in industry, but big pictures are<br>harder. This is because real life has lots of details. Knowing how to remove<br>the details and see the essence is the skill that is hard to learn in industry<br>precisely because the essence alone is never enough. But the essence is<br>critical for making strategic decisions. However, when people start out, they<br>don’t usually get to make strategic decisions. So there is a gap — a time<br>during which you are learning a lot in industry and not seeing the full<br>advantage of your Berkeley education. This is fine from our point of view —<br>we are teaching you with the time-scale of decades in our mind.</p>
<h3 id="Followup-111"><a href="#Followup-111" class="headerlink" title="Followup:"></a>Followup:</h3><p>Student:<br>I didn’t mean to imply a wrote a program that could generate english. That<br>would probably be beyond my abilities (at least, if I wanted it to be<br>coherent….). The course was History of Information (a great course<br>overall!), and we were talking about the effects of the dictionary on the<br>development of language and how that affected word choice. I was in 61A at the<br>time, and we had just learned to use dictionaries (the Python kind, of course)<br>and so I though it would be fun to do things like word count on a couple texts<br>we were given as well as some basic statistics and to find data to explore the<br>same topics. It was nothing super rigorous, but I found it to be a good way to<br>practice Python (of which I needed lots of practice them!) and to explore the<br>topic in a way that I figured most people would not. Based on what I learned<br>from messing around I used that to write the reading response which gave me a<br>bit more depth and thus made the word count thing easier. :) I mean, I can BS<br>my way to a word count any day [hello AP courses!] but assignments are much<br>more fun when you can complete them without needing to do that.</p>

<h3 id="Anant-Sahai’s-answer-96"><a href="#Anant-Sahai’s-answer-96" class="headerlink" title="Anant Sahai’s answer"></a>Anant Sahai’s answer</h3><p>“Sophomore mathematical maturity” is a prerequisite for CS70. This practically<br>means the mathematical maturity acquired by taking EE16AB and/or Math 53/54.<br>In our experience, students who lack the appropriate level of mathematical<br>maturity tend to find CS70 excruciatingly painful and CS70 is a reasonably<br>hard course even for those who have the mathematical maturity it expects.</p>
<p>The EECS department believes that all the lower division courses are pretty<br>vital. It’s not even so much about the specific technical details that you<br>learn, although those are important and useful. It is about the perspectives,<br>context, and ways of thinking. That is what really helps you in the long term.<br>Taking these courses is about helping you ask questions as much as it is about<br>helping you answer them. Others can often help you answer questions when you<br>are working. Fewer folks are available to help you ask questions.</p>
<p>That said, there are a vast range of software development jobs out there and<br>knowing 61AB, 70, 170, 160, and 188 is actually not a very weak foundation, as<br>long as you work hard to keep on learning. The lack of 61C would be a pretty<br>glaring hole though. 61C and 162 are very important perspectives for a<br>practical software developer, especially if they are ever want to be engaged<br>in work that demands high performance. Real-world performance is often less<br>about Big-O issues and more about cache misses.</p>

I don’t think all EECS professors learned machine learning in<br>undergrad / PhD years, hence they must have had to learn on their own. How did<br>they achieve this?</p>
<p>I ask because learning to learn is one of the most useful skills ever.<br>Considering Professors have to constantly absorb large amounts of knowledge<br>(entire fields) without taking courses, I want to know what techniques they<br>suggest for us. Thank you in advance.</p>
<h3 id="Anant-Sahai’s-answer-97"><a href="#Anant-Sahai’s-answer-97" class="headerlink" title="Anant Sahai’s answer"></a>Anant Sahai’s answer</h3><p>“Sophomore mathematical maturity” is a prerequisite for CS70. This practically<br>means the mathematical maturity acquired by taking EE16AB and/or Math 53/54.<br>In our experience, students who lack the appropriate level of mathematical<br>maturity tend to find CS70 excruciatingly painful and CS70 is a reasonably<br>hard course even for those who have the mathematical maturity it expects.</p>
<p>The EECS department believes that all the lower division courses are pretty<br>vital. It’s not even so much about the specific technical details that you<br>learn, although those are important and useful. It is about the perspectives,<br>context, and ways of thinking. That is what really helps you in the long term.<br>Taking these courses is about helping you ask questions as much as it is about<br>helping you answer them. Others can often help you answer questions when you<br>are working. Fewer folks are available to help you ask questions.</p>
<p>That said, there are a vast range of software development jobs out there and<br>knowing 61AB, 70, 170, 160, and 188 is actually not a very weak foundation, as<br>long as you work hard to keep on learning. The lack of 61C would be a pretty<br>glaring hole though. 61C and 162 are very important perspectives for a<br>practical software developer, especially if they are ever want to be engaged<br>in work that demands high performance. Real-world performance is often less<br>about Big-O issues and more about cache misses.</p>
<h2 id="CS-Town-Halls-too-politically-correct"><a href="#CS-Town-Halls-too-politically-correct" class="headerlink" title="CS Town Halls too politically correct"></a>CS Town Halls too politically correct</h2><p>2017-02-26<br>I attended the CS town hall meeting on Tuesday. Minutes:<br><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1i9hiXp6bgFLsSe6i91gy7HaGVTpCiUw2gJi-

<p>Why is everyone so politically correct at these town hall meetings? We have so<br>many more important things to discuss. How can we more regularly offer courses<br>[like CS 288]? How can we deal with long waitlists? How can we afford more<br>tuition waivers for TAs? These are the real issues CS students want to<br>discuss. Open forums with Professors are rare. I, and most CS students, would<br>rather not waste the chance on safe spaces/playing victim card/dividing people<br>by race, gender, sexuality.</p>
<p>-—————————————————————————————————–</p>
<p><strong>“ EECS Master Race” is offensive/hurtful to those inside and outside of our<br>department”</strong></p>
<p>Relax, it’s just a joke. No one ever meant harm.</p>
<p><strong>“ As a female and a minority I definitely feel like I don’t belong when none<br>of my TAs or professors look like me.”</strong></p>
<p>This is a non-issue. TAs and Professors are hired on their merits, not on<br>gender or color of their skin. Also, it’s not all about race. People can be<br>similar without having the same skin color.</p>
<p>“When [a female student] suggested including a woman on the interview board<br>for one of these organizations <strong>she was told that “men and women don’t<br>interview differently” so there’s no need to include a woman on the board, and<br>that she should “stop pulling the girl card for everything</strong>.”</p>
<p>What’s so controversial here? People should be chosen based on merits, not<br>gender. ALL people are created equal. This includes people of all genders,<br>sexualities and ethnic backgrounds.</p>
<p><strong>“ TAs are dismissive or lack understanding/empathy, this can be especially<br>difficult for those who come in without CS backgrounds or underrepresented<br>students”</strong></p>
<p>I’ve been at Cal 3 years and not once have I had a bad TA. In any of my CS<br>courses. Not once. Our TAs are the most energetic, enthusiastic, and<br>intelligent people I’ve ever known at Cal. These are people that write books<br>for students (like Sinho Chewi, Alvin Wan), respond to Slack/text messages at<br>all hours of the day, and answer your piazza questions without even being<br>students (Steven Bi). Please find someone else to blame. We CS students love<br>our TAs.</p>
<p>“Students from <a href="http://ucbessa.berkeley.edu" target="_blank" rel="external">BESSA</a> (Black Engineering and<br>Sciences Student Association) expressed that they feel that enough is not<br>being done…. <strong>Reported that BESSA lacks the resources to provide services<br>like tutoring, given their few numbers. “</strong></p>
<p>Okay….Whose fault is that?</p>
<p>-—————————————————————————————————————————————————</p>
<p>I propose students vote on the topics discussed at these town halls. We CS<br>students have our frustrations, but they are NOT what the department believes<br>they are. The complaints described above do not represent the CS student body.</p>
<h3 id="Anant-Sahai’s-answer-98"><a href="#Anant-Sahai’s-answer-98" class="headerlink" title="Anant Sahai’s answer"></a>Anant Sahai’s answer</h3><p>Different town halls have focused on different topics. Think about it<br>logically. If the department wanted to understand the full breadth and scope<br>of student concerns, and wanted to do so over the course of multiple town<br>halls, then what would be a better strategy?</p>
<p>A) Having each town hall be completely open and free-form as to topic, thereby<br>getting lots of people voicing the same issues over and over again.</p>
<p>B) Having a general town hall, student surveys, followed by topic-specific<br>town hall meetings so that a broader scope of student concerns can be heard.</p>
<p>(Optional technical exercise: in what ways is this like or unlike the use of<br>linear vs nonlinear signaling for communicating over a noisy channel? If you<br>get to use a noisy channel repeatedly to communicate a single Gaussian random<br>variable, how does the performance scale with linear approaches? What scaling<br>can you get with nonlinear approaches?)</p>
<p>The issue of course offerings and increasing the TA budget have already been<br>discussed. There are things being done trying to resolve this and<br>fundamentally, those are about getting campus to give faculty slots and TA<br>money to the department. Inclusivity, on the other hand, is incredibly<br>important and had not been discussed nearly enough. EECS values inclusion.<br>Language like “victim card” and the like might seem like mere rhetorical<br>flourishes to some of you, but such language and behavior acts as a way to<br>exclude many people. Humans have feelings and are social creatures.<br>Exclusion/inclusion is not some third-order effect for systems of interacting<br>humans.</p>
<p>(Optional technical exercise, in case simple decency of being inclusive isn’t<br>enough: when one is designing a control system that has multiple state<br>dimensions and dynamics that couple them, is the optimal control strategy<br>going to be to only consider the dimension of the state that you care about?<br>Why or why not?)</p>
<p>The rigor of thinking that the EECS department wishes to inculcate in its<br>students is not limited to questions involving software or circuits or devices<br>or mathematical models that we give you. The goal is for you to be able to<br>think critically and rigorously about problems in general. One of the<br>important principles here is not assuming that everyone else is a fool. It’s<br>alright to not understand something. That’s normal. You might question<br>something because it doesn’t make sense to you. That’s also good. But to jump<br>from there to assume that the people in charge are in the grips of something<br>nefarious like “Political Correctness” isn’t logical. It’s arrogant.<br><em>Humility</em> is a vital attribute for engineers. Approach questions sincerely.<br><em>Arrogance</em> can be fatal in practice.</p>
<p>It is good that you appreciate your TAs. And it is good that you have high<br>esteem for your faculty. But you should also have some trust that these same<br>good TAs and faculty are trying to achieve something when we want to<br>understand how to improve inclusivity. Just because you have not experienced<br>something doesn’t mean that it does not exist.</p>
<h3 id="Followup-112"><a href="#Followup-112" class="headerlink" title="Followup:"></a>Followup:</h3><p>Student:<br>Students did vote on which topics were discussed; in several surveys.</p>
<h3 id="Followup-113"><a href="#Followup-113" class="headerlink" title="Followup:"></a>Followup:</h3><p>Student:<br>@OP who asked “And what’s the alternative? Hire under-qualified people based<br>on their race or gender?”</p>
<p>Actually, no, but sadly that’s a prevalent misconception. There are definitely<br>constraints you can relax without compromising on “qualifications” to address<br>this issue, which AFAIK the department already does. One example of such a<br>requirement is compensating via the faculty’s research area. You can adjust<br>quotas for hiring faculty in areas A vs. B to compensate for factors like this<br>without compromising on qualifications or merits at all.</p>
<p>To put it into mathematical terms, this is a dynamic multi-objective problem<br>with lots of soft constraints, not a static single-objective problem with only<br>hard constraints. So solutions like the above do exist.</p>
<p>Student:<br>+1 meritocracy is a myth</p>
<p>Student:<br>America has made mistakes. So let’s learn from them instead of reinstating<br>discrimination.</p>
<p>Student:<br>tbh the whole merit argument is built on the assumption that everyone has the<br>same starting point and therefore is a self-serving meritocracy. The truth is<br>that we do not due to many historical reasons and whatsoever we were just not<br>enlightened and deprived people of right to education and equal opportunities<br>coz we were dumb.</p>
<p>While one could easily argue that political correctness has been<br>“overwhelming” on campus, colleges across the country, like Caltech, started<br>admitting female students till 1970 which is like not so long ago. The point I<br>am trying to make is that to break the perpetuating historical stereotypes,<br>one needs to have certain favorable policies or programs to make up for the<br>gap and I agree, it is super hard to draw the line of being “fair” and make up<br>to the minorities just “right”, but the whole idea of “OH YOU SUCK THAT’S WHY<br>WE DO NOT WANT YOU” is harmful, unhelpful and ultimately unfair: if there was<br>no equal opportunities granted in the first place how would there be fair<br>competitions anyway?</p>
<p>Everyone likes meritocracy but plz, not a self-serving one.</p>
<p>Student:<br>“select a faculty and staff of TAs thats as brilliant and diverse as the group<br>of students they hope to teach.”</p>
<p>Is this compatible with evaluating people ONLY based on their merits? Not<br>based on any other criteria such as their skin color? If so, I support the<br>idea.</p>
<p>Student:<br>There’s this thing called implicit bias that has played a huge role in why<br>women/minority groups have had such a difficult time growing in number in<br>tech, or even rising to positions of leadership. Implicit bias takes form in<br>the subtle stereotypes or judgements that we hold about groups of people. For<br>example when we don’t see many women in STEM fields, both at student and<br>professor levels, we believe that its because women are less qualified or may<br>not be smart enough to pursue those fields in great numbers. This notion<br>carries forward in how we interact with women in these environments later on,<br>as our first impression of them may be subconsciously clouded by this idea we<br>have.</p>
<p>So while a female professor may be just as, if not more, qualified as her male<br>counterpart, perhaps the individuals interviewing her had their perspectives<br>colored in this same way and didn’t take her as seriously because she was a<br>woman. Representation is extremely important, not only for other girls to see<br>so that they understand that STEM isn’t just a field for guys, but also<br>because it helps fight against the idea that only certain groups of people are<br>qualified to do something.</p>
<p>So no. The alternative isn’t to hire under-qualified people based on their<br>gender. Quite the opposite in fact. We need to take into account how our<br>perspectives may be colored by subconscious biases, and actively look for ways<br>to select a faculty and staff of TAs thats as brilliant and diverse as the<br>group of students they hope to teach.</p>
<p>Student:<br>OP Here. Thank you Daniel for your comment.</p>
<p><strong>“ It can become very easy to think  “well maybe CS just isn’t for girls” if<br>you don’t see female professors or TAs. And that point follows similarly for<br>other minority groups in CS.”</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>True. And what’s the alternative? Hire under-qualified people based on their<br>race or gender? We students are paying a lot of money for a good education<br>here. A good education, not a politically correct one. Gender or minority<br>status should not be part of the equation at all. Merit is the only thing that<br>should matter.</p>
<h3 id="Followup-114"><a href="#Followup-114" class="headerlink" title="Followup:"></a>Followup:</h3><p>Student:<br>In response to:<br>“I agree diversity is important. But why are people obsessed about racial<br>diversity? There’s also intellectual diversity and diversity of opinion which<br>are far more important than the color of someone’s skin.

If the males on the interview board were more qualified than<br>the female, choose the males. Is that so controversial?”</p>
<p>Due to implicit bias, the interview panel may determine the underrepresented<br>minority candidate to be less qualified not because of his/her CV, but because<br>of his/her appearance. It’s already shown that in academic hiring situations,<br>a CV with a male sounding name is more likely to be chosen for an interview<br>than a CV with a female sounding name, despite the rest of the CVs being<br>identical. Even the most “woke” among us can suffer from implicit biases based<br>on gender/race/accent/dress/etc. that we must constantly challenge and put<br>into question when interacting with others, especially during faculty<br>interviewing processes.  </p>
<p>I am nearing the end of my PhD here at Berkeley, preparing to enter the<br>Silicon Valley work force. I am also a petite female. When I walk into any<br>sort of professional situation with new people, I know that the first thing<br>I’m going to have to do is work extra hard to project experience,<br>intelligence, and authority. I love wearing dresses that look like they came<br>from Claire Underwood’s closet, but I’m an engineer, so I should stick to<br>pants so that I don’t come off as too feminine and get taken less seriously<br>(note the second half of this sentence - case and point right there). I can’t<br>be too assertive or they might think I’m bossy; no, much better to phrase<br>ideas as passive suggestions with an extra shot of humility. I can’t write an<br>efficient email listing action items without running the risk of rubbing<br>someone the wrong way. On my first day of EE375, I was asked (by another<br>woman) if I was a reader for my course. I was in fact a 5th year PhD student<br>and Head GSI, but based on nothing but my appearance she assumed that I was on<br>the bottom rung of pedagogical the totem pole. Implicit bias exists (this is<br>covered nicely in EE375 by the way) and we can be guilty of applying it even<br>to people who look like us. Thus, interview committees need to acknowledge<br>their own implicit biases and take them into account when weighing candidates’<br>qualifications, so race, ethnicity, and gender can’t be ignored.</p>
<p>Student:<br>Students voted on which topics were discussed in several surveys.</p>
<p>Student:<br>CSM sections and HKN office hours are not explicitly held by TAs… get your<br>facts straight.</p>
<p>Student:<br>“Maybe 5-10 students in the major of hundreds are arrogant.”</p>
<p>A disagree with almost everything you’re trying to express but this is the<br>first thing that made me lol.</p>
<p>Student:<br>OP Here.</p>
<p><strong>EECS Master Race</strong></p>
<p>I don’t know of a single EECS major who has acted condescendingly towards<br>another student based on his major. Maybe 5-10 students in the major of<br>hundreds are arrogant. It’s inevitable. It’s not an actual problem.</p>
<p><strong>Minority Representation</strong></p>
<p>Second off, while I agree that people should be chosen based off merits, an<br>important aspect to consider is perspective. People with different backgrounds<br>and life experiences can have vastly different perspectives that give them<br>insight into different problems. This is why striving to be more diverse can<br>strengthen the community.”</p>
<p>I agree diversity is important. But why are people obsessed about racial<br>diversity? There’s also intellectual diversity and diversity of opinion which<br>are far more important than the color of someone’s skin. Also, let’s judge<br>people based on their merits, not the color of their skin. Racial<br>discrimination is illegal and immoral, and this includes reverse<br>discrimination. If the males on the interview board were more qualified than<br>the female, choose the males. Is that so controversial?</p>
<p><strong>TAs</strong></p>
<p>“TAs are dismissive or lack understanding/empathy, this can be especially<br>difficult for those who come in without CS backgrounds or underrepresented<br>students”</p>
<hr>
<p>TAs can always improve. But the complaint implies that TAs don’t do enough for<br>people without CS backgrounds / underrepresented students. This is<br>categorically false. Do the complainers not see the review sessions that TAs<br>put on? Do they not see CSM sections? Do they not see HKN office hours? Do<br>they not see homework parties? Do they not see project parties? You cannot<br>complain TAs are not doing enough. Underrepresented students have the same, in<br>fact more, opportunities than the rest of us (they have affirmative action<br>internships like Facebook University).</p>
<h3 id="Followup-115"><a href="#Followup-115" class="headerlink" title="Followup:"></a>Followup:</h3><p>Student:<br>@OP lmaooooo. Quote from other comment saying “the world is an unfair place,<br>let’s give everybody more opportunities”</p>
<p>OK, so we had an EECS town hall about diversity and giving underrepresented<br>people more opportunities. But oh noooooo, now that’s being too “politically<br>correct”, those issues “don’t really matter”… so the question I have is,</p>
<p>what does your ideal solution look like? I agree that in this situation, where<br>resources are limited and the world is an unequal place, sometimes lifting<br>people up requires some sacrifices. It’s not a perfect solution. But do you<br>have any better ones in mind? The alternative you mention in which we ignore<br>these issues and focus on “merit” is so hollow. There doesn’t exist a single<br>merit-based system in the world that doesn’t favor the rich and disadvantage<br>the poor.</p>
<p>Even Asian education systems, especially in China, which started out being<br>very merit-based and allowing for a lot of economic mobility are now falling<br>apart. The nouveau rich in China afford better tutors and better schools, and<br>inequality is growing rapidly there. In the US, those economic stressors are<br>split even more among racial groups, due to a long and complicated history<br>with race and immigration in the US. If you think a “merit based system”<br>somehow decreases inequality from an economic or racial standpoint, I have a<br>bridge to sell you.</p>
<p>It really boils down to this. Is the current system equal? Obviously not. Can<br>it be made equal? We can try. Does a merit-based system fix this? No, it has<br>never worked anywhere. So what should we do? Well, let’s talk about it…<br>maybe at a town hall…</p>
<p>Student:<br>But diversity is important, because different people have different needs<br>based on their background. Here’s a great example: in the original release of<br>the Health app on iPhone’s, Apple didn’t include a menstrual cycle tracker.<br>You could track any amount of obscure vitamins/minerals/healing crystals, but<br>you couldn’t keep track of your reproductive health. (Here’s a good<br><a href="http://fusion.net/story/100781/apple-ios-update-new-version-of-
healthkit-still-doesnt-track-periods/" target="_blank" rel="external">article</a> on the issue.)</p>
<p>Student:<br>OP Here.</p>
<p>1. Yes, we should provide BESSA with proper funding and resources.<br>Absolutely. But they have no right to complain about “not having enough<br>students” as if that’s the department’s fault.</p>
<p>1.5. I think diversity should not be a factor at all in recruiting. Maybe more<br>diversity is a good thing but imagine if you were the totally qualified<br>student constantly turned away because clubs/companies wanted to impose some<br>racial quotas? Discrimination is illegal and immoral.</p>
<p>2. My bad. I didn’t mean “not a single student” but rather “not many<br>students”. This is why I propose having a survey for EECS students to vent<br>their concerns. These PC problems will appear at the very bottom of your list.</p>
<p>3. I know what affirmative action is about. It has a good purpose in mind.<br>But it’s immoral and ought to be illegal. How can you tell someone you’re<br>rejecting them only based on their skin color and feel happy about it?</p>
<p>Student:<br>1. Okay, but BESSA is one such group, and you don’t want to listen to their<br>complaints about not having enough resources. So we should expand BESSA and<br>provide them with more funding and resources correct?</p>
<p>As someone in that position, yes. I am in charge of recruiting for certain<br>clubs, and I still believe in taking diversity into account when deciding what<br>candidates to accept. It sucks, but the reality is that the various<br>perspectives brought in due to diversity far outweighs the difference between<br>a 3.5 and a 4.0 in the candidates.</p>
<p>2. You are complaining about students complaining about diversity in EECS. So<br>obviously students in EECS have complained about the lack of diversity,<br>otherwise we wouldn’t even be having this conversation.</p>
<p>3. Yes, affirmative action is about giving disadvantaged people more<br>opportunities.</p>
<p>Student:<br>OP Here.</p>
<p>1. True, merit only works for equal opportunity. So let’s work on giving<br>people equal opportunities instead of punishing people who are not of a<br>underrepresented group / had well-off parents. We have Women in Tech, Black<br>Girls Code, etc movements that provide resources for women, African Americans,<br>etc. Let’s expand those programs.</p>
<p>Tell me this. If you’re an Asian EECS major, 4.0, aced all the interviews, but<br>keeps getting rejected due to the color of your skin, would you still support<br>affirmative action then?</p>
<p>2. I have not heard a single student complain about diversity in EECS.<br>However, I always hear students complain about long waitlists/not being able<br>to take classes they want/no tuition waiver as a TA. In fact, browse the past<br>history of this EECS 101 piazza and compare the number of these complaints to<br>complaints of “not enough diversity / pro-affirmative action”</p>
<p>3. And not everyone has the same opportunity to be a lawyer. Or a doctor. The<br>world is an unfair placd. The way we make it fairer is to give everyone more<br>opportunities rather than snatch opportunities from people.</p>
<p>Student:<br>1. How do you even define merit. How do you compare the ‘merit’ of 2 people<br>if one of them went to a rich private school and has been taking coding<br>classes for 5+ years while the other couldn’t even afford a computer? Merit<br>only works if everyone has equal opportunity, which is not the case.</p>
<p>2. Where is your data that a majority of students don’t care about these<br>problems? Have you managed to create an accurate/representative poll of<br>undergrad EECS/CS majors? And just because the problems presented only affect<br>a (sizable) minority of students, we should completely ignore them? A problem<br>is still a problem even if it affects &lt;50% of the students.</p>
<p>3. Not everyone has the same opportunities to enter tech, which is what leads<br>to the lack of diversity in the first place.</p>
<p>Student:<br>1. This is off topic but why should the admissions office consider economic<br>status? Merit, and only merit, should be considered. Not wealth, not race, not<br>anything else. Diversity is nice but merit comes first every time.</p>
<p>2. As I mentioned, this issue doesn’t affect me and most CS students. Most<br>students want the department to focus on the problems that actually exist and<br>affect our education rather than solving politically correct problems which<br>aren’t actually problems.</p>
<p>3. Lack of diversity is real, the numbers don’t lie. But so what? If everyone<br>has the same opportunities to enter tech, then why does it matter if most<br>people in tech are male or Asian/white? Lack of diversity is not a problem.</p>
<p>Males are disproportionately represented amongst construction workers. Does<br>that mean discrimination against women?</p>
<p>Females are disproportionately represented among teachers. Does that mean<br>discrimination against men?</p>
<p>No, it’s just people gravitating towards fields they’re interested in. No need<br>to politicize everything.</p>
<p>Student:<br>1. How do you determine who is qualified enough to get acceptance into<br>Berkeley EECS? Based on what people did in high school? What about the people<br>(mostly underrepresented minority students) who didn’t have the opportunity to<br>do any CS or EE in high school? The admissions office doesn’t even consider<br>race, but it does consider economic status, which is strongly correlated with<br>race. And that leads to more diversity. And it starts from the bottom up: less<br>diversity in undergrads –&gt; less diversity in TAs.</p>
<p>2. Who are you to decide what the professors spend their time on? We just had<br>a town hall last semester about the lack of funding for EECS (covered course<br>shrinkage, long waitlists, etc). And just because this issue doesn’t affect<br>you doesn’t mean that it doesn’t matter.</p>
<p>3. HKN doesn’t even get money from the department. “ <em>for a problem that<br>doesn ‘t exist”</em> what problem are you referring to? The lack of diversity?<br>Because that is a very real and well-documented problem in tech.</p>
<p>Student:<br>We complain about it for three reasons.</p>
<p>1. <strong>Their arguments aren ‘t logical. </strong>I don’t see how Berkeley EECS has a<br>diversity problem. We choose the most qualified students, TAs, and Professors.<br>If that means less diversity, fine, but there’s no problem. And most of their<br>concerns are frankly absurd, like the BESA thing. Please pinpoint an <em>actual</em><br>problem first.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Don ‘t waste town halls. </strong>If you have legimitate concerns, you should<br>be welcome to bring them up. But you don’t need a town hall with Professors.<br>We don’t have town halls on the issues EECS students care about, but we have<br>town halls on this. Faculty time is limited and should be spent on the issues<br>that matter.</p>
<p>3. <strong>It ‘s not a zero sum game. </strong>If the problems brought up in these town<br>halls are “solved”, you hurt 99% of students. Taking money from HKN and giving<br>it to BESA _for a problem that doesn ‘t exist _means HKN doesn’t offer<br>tutoring, provide cookies after exams, or shuts down its exam archive. Hiring<br>TAs based on their skin color rather than merit <em>for a problem that doesn ‘t<br>exist</em>, not only is illegal and immoral, but it also deprives us of a good<br>education.</p>
<p>So yeah, we care. Because it hurts us all.</p>
<p>Student:<br>So. The first time I <em>ever</em> see an EECS department townhall dedicated to<br>addressing marginalized folks ‘ concerns, someone has to post a complaint<br>about it. Your complaints about class sizes and tuition are valid, of course,<br>but dragging underrepresented folks down too? The many times I’ve seen people<br>request classes be expanded, on Piazza or elsewhere, I’ve <em>seen</em> staff do it.<br>They ‘ve LISTENED to you. Expanded classes. Answering demands on future<br>classes offered. But this is the first time I ever hear <strong>anyone</strong> talk about<br>diversity. Not even concrete plans to do anything. Just a townhall to<br><strong>talk</strong>. But this post blows it up as though we were donating half the<br>department ‘s funding towards a student group. How selfish, to begrudge us<br>that.</p>

<p>Student:<br>You should read more about that protest a few months ago. I’m usually against<br>the extreme liberalism of Berkeley, but those student groups had very valid<br>complaints.</p>
<p>I don’t really know what the Milo incident has to do with this post. A large<br>majority of them aren’t affiliated with Berkeley.</p>
<p>EECS is no less underfunded than all of the other departments at Berkeley. We<br>might actually be better off than most; at least admin didn’t try to dissolve<br>our college like they did with College of Chem. A department town hall isn’t<br>going to do anything when the problem is at a much higher (regents, state)<br>level.</p>
<p>Student:<br>Thank you for your comment.</p>
<p>“How can we more regularly offer courses [like CS 288]? How can we deal with<br>long waitlists? How can we afford more tuition waivers for TAs?”</p>
<p><strong>I wish these problems were discussed more as well. If you asked these<br>questions at a town hall, I bet a good chunk of the audience would think to<br>themselves, “what stupid, annoying questions”.</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>I disagree with this, however. A good chunk of the audience would be delighted<br>to hear their actual concerns being addressed. EECS students are tired of the<br>political correctness taking over Berkeley.</p>
<p>Few months ago, we had protesters block Sather Gate because they wanted a<br>“sexuality center” or waste of money like that. Then they stormed the Student<br>Store. And guess what? They succeeded. Meanwhile we our department is<br>underfunded, we can’t even get into the classes we want, and the classes we<br>want to take aren’t available for us.</p>
<p>Then, earlier this month, antifa’s / anarchists destroyed our Amazon ASUC<br>because they couldn’t deal with someone exercising their right to free speech.<br>Later on, these groups justified their violence in the Daily Cal.</p>

<p>Student:<br>Can’t see that link / use the Berkeley proxy anymore, since my CalNet account<br>expired.</p>
<p>I can’t talk personally about discrimination about women professors, because<br>I’m not one. I’ll note that I haven’t taken a single CS course with a female<br>professor, which does say something about the department.</p>
<p>Otherwise, see all of anon’s comments above.</p>
<p>And we’re <em>currently</em> in a world where people equally qualified of other races<br>and genders never even get to develop their skills and change the world,<br>because they aren ‘t represented and given that opportunity.</p>
<p>Student:<br>It’s unproductive to say that some method has not shown perfect results, hence<br>we should end that strategy and instead do nothing.</p>
<p>Discrimination against female professors is not easy to prove on such a small<br>level but we know that there is unconscious (and some conscious) bias against<br>women across STEM fields therefore there is unconscious bias against women in<br>CS, and unless you can actually argue otherwise, there is the same bias<br>present at UC Berkeley. This is something that is large and institutional and<br>takes place at many levels.</p>
<p>You discuss qualifications like they are an objective standard. Minority<br>groups benefiting from affirmative action often will not be evaluated equally.<br>No single decision will be obviously sexist, but the net result will be that<br>female professors almost always end up not being chosen if qualifications are<br>basically equal, and a choice of either candidate would be defensible.</p>
<p>Student:<br>OP Here.</p>
<p>Thank you for posting that link. It shows that even with affirmative action in<br>place, we don’t have too many women as professors. So affirmative action is<br>clearly not the solution.</p>
<p>UC Berkeley doesn’t discriminate against women professors. Give me a single<br>example of discrimination against women professors here. It doesn’t exist. We<br>choose the most qualified people and that’s it. Berkeley won’t be the greatest<br>public university if we start focus on creating a politically correct<br>education rather than a good education. Do you want a world where the Sahai’s,<br>Papadimitriou’s, Patterson’s and Denero’s of the world can’t get tenure<br>because they weren’t “underrepresented” enough?</p>

<p>Student:<br>OP Here.</p>
<p>There is a limited number of positions on interview boards and course staff.<br>So we have to deal with this scarcity somehow. The way Berkeley currently does<br>it is chose the people most qualified for the position. What most people are<br>suggesting here is “let’s have qualified people, but also add women/minorities<br>even if they’re not qualified.”</p>
<p>No. This is discrimination against men/Asians/whites based on<br>gender/ethnicity. It is immoral and illegal under the US Constitution.</p>
<p>Student:<br>But there’s a difference between affirmative action in tenuring Professors and<br>having women/minorities on interview boards and on auxiliary course staff.<br>Diversity is not some binary thing where it exists or doesn’t exist. There are<br>clear areas where introducing diversity doesn’t diminish quality that we can<br>improve on.</p>
<p>Student:<br>OP Here. I sympathize for your experience growing up. I do. But affirmative<br>action doesn’t solve the problem you describe. Do you think people of other<br>races are going to like you more if they are rejected for jobs <em>they are more<br>qualified for</em> , just to meet some racial quota?</p>
<p>I understand the value of diversity like everyone else here. But I don’t want<br>to force diversity upon students and diminish the education they are paying so<br>much for.

<h3 id="Followup-119"><a href="#Followup-119" class="headerlink" title="Followup:"></a>Followup:</h3><p>Student:<br>One poster claimed that Asians are “extremely well-represented in tech”.

For whatever reason even white women outnumber<br>Asian males in tech management / executive positions.</p>
<p>Student:<br><strong>There are ways to improve diversity without diluting talent</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>I disagree. Either you value diversity the most or you value talent the most,<br>there’s no “middle ground”. I choose talent the most because I (along with the<br>majority of people) believe people should be chosen on their merits and not on<br>their skin color.</p>
<p><strong>Because we are not in construction or teaching or law. We are in tech. This<br>distinction should be simple enough.</strong></p>
<p>Fair enough. My point is, I’ve never heard for “Men in Teaching” or “Women in<br>Construction” movements. So there is some hypocrisy.</p>
<p>Student:</p>
<pre><code>But it&apos;s not about helping them, is it? It&apos;s about some people who play the victim card for self gain. It&apos;s easier to complain &quot;my group is underrepresented in tech so hire me though I&apos;m not qualified&quot; than do the work and get the job fairly.

<p>1. It’s not “alarmist rhetoric”. The student is just expressing non-PC<br>opinions. If people have the right to speak for gender + race discrimination,<br>so do people who don’t support affirmative action.</p>
<p>2. So what if Asian males are well represented in the tech community? These<br>are people who work hard to get into top schools, work hard to get<br>internships, work hard to become TAs, and work hard to become software<br>engineers. It’s not discrimination. Why don’t people mention the fact that<br>women are underrepresented in construction? Or men in teaching? Or Asians in<br>farming? Or Hispanics in lawyers?

<p>Student:<br>“When [a female student] suggested including a woman on the interview board<br>for one of these organizations <strong>she was told that “men and women don’t<br>interview differently” so there’s no need to include a woman on the board, and<br>that she should “stop pulling the girl card for everything</strong>.”</p>
<p><strong>“ As a female and a minority I definitely feel like I don’t belong when none<br>of my TAs or professors look like me.</strong> <strong>“</strong></p>

<p>And making it more equitable doesn’t require discriminating against people<br>based on their gender or race.</p>
<p>Student:</p>
<pre><code>That&apos;s the way the world is and it can&apos;t be changed. 
</code></pre><p>If that’s a fundamental view of yours, then you’ll never understand the point<br>of any of these culture town halls. And there is no further use explaining it<br>to you. But a lot of us don’t hold that belief, and believe the actions we do<br>here are Berkeley can break this cycle.</p>
<p>Student:<br>Look, the fact is the world isn’t a fair place. Barron Trump has advantages<br>I’ll never have. And I have advantages an African American student in inner<br>city Chicago doesn’t have. That’s the way the world is and it can’t be<br>changed. We can provide more opportunities to people, like “Black Girls Code”,<br>“One Hour of Code”, etc, (which by the way are well-funded and promoted by top<br>politicians including the POTUS, so you can’t complain there aren’t role<br>models) but we can never create a fully level playing field.</p>
<p>Ultimately, success in life comes from self motivation. Even if there aren’t<br>many role models for Black students, if they truly like CS, they can learn<br>themselves. You have middle school kids these days making top 100 App Store<br>apps. You have to try. Don’t expect anyone to force you to.</p>
<p>Student:<br>And why is it that Black students feel discouraged from pursuing CS. It’s<br>because there aren’t role models in the US for them. This is a long term,<br>cyclical issue.</p>
<p>Student:<br>It’s society’s fault. Look at high schools that are majority Asian/white<br>compared to those that are majority African-American/Hispanic. Look at which<br>ones have computer science programs that can get high school students<br>interested in CS. You can’t be interested in CS if you were never exposed to<br>it in the first place.</p>
<p>Student:<br>Still, whose fault is that? Whose fault is it that African American students<br>are not so interested in CS? It’s no one’s fault. So instead of them blaming<br>the department for not discriminating, we could be discussing issues students<br>care about.</p>
<p>Student:</p>
<pre><code>&quot;Students from BESSA (Black Engineering and Sciences Student Association) expressed that they feel that enough is not being done....Reported that BESSA lacks the resources to provide services like tutoring, given their few numbers.&quot;

<p>Student:<br><a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-diversity-makes-us-smarter/" target="_blank" rel="external">https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-diversity-makes-us-smarter/</a></p>
<p>Student:<br>Anon:</p>
<p>I’m the author of this post.</p>
<p>First of all, I mentioned I’m a CS and Physics double major because I wanted<br>to refute OP’s argument that I don’t want to work hard and get the job fairly<br>so I’m complaining that I should be hired despite not being qualified just<br>because I belong to an underrepresented group.</p>
<p>You said yourself that I’m “probably already in the top 1% of Berkeley<br>students” — so that means I’m qualified. And as for working hard: there’s no<br>affirmative action for SAT scores or GPA, and Berkeley does not practice<br>affirmative action in admissions. I myself got the test scores needed to get<br>into Berkeley with a scholarship, despite having a weak educational background<br>(my formal education ended with the second grade), then the GPA needed to<br>declare the CS major and the skills needed to get research positions and an<br>internship. How did I work any less hard to get where I am than any of those<br>white/Asian males you’re talking about in your last paragraph? Do you still<br>want to imply that all of them are working harder than I am and I’m still just<br>playing the victim?</p>
<p>Second of all, when did I ever say that women and underrepresented minorities<br>are the ONLY ones who can be disadvantaged? I’m Asian-American myself, so I<br>definitely aware that there have been cases of racism against Asians in tech<br>(see the U.S. Department of Labor suing Palantir for anti-Asian<br>discrimination, and Trump’s top advisor, Steve Bannon, saying that there are<br>too many Asian CEOs in Silicon Valley, when in fact Asians are<br>underrepresented in management — and you’re still advocating for re-electing<br>Trump?). I also know that many Asian-Americans come from impoverished families<br>with parents who may be refugees or who haven’t even completed high school<br>degrees, and that people of all genders and races can come from poor<br>backgrounds with lack of educational opportunities. I’m not saying that if<br>someone is a white/Asian male, they automatically face 0 problems, ever.</p>
<p>However, as a white/Asian guy in tech, you will never get comments from your<br>coworkers about what you’re wearing, or messages from your boss harassing you<br>for sex. You will never get coworkers telling you how unfair it is that you<br>get a “vacation” when in fact you’re taking maternity leave to have a child.<br>You will never get your classmates or GSIs assuming that you’re less<br>competent, ignoring what you’re saying, interrupting you to tell you things<br>you already know, and asking you whether you’re sure you’re in the right<br>classroom, just because you’re a girl in a dress. You will never look around<br>the room and feel like you’re the odd one out and like you shouldn’t even be<br>here.</p>
<p>Is it true that some women and underrepresented minorities don’t make it in<br>tech because they’re not interested or don’t work hard enough? Definitely. But<br>are you really going to say that white/Asian males just naturally have <em>so</em><br>much more interest and <em>so</em> much better of a work ethic that it ‘s the ONLY<br>reason why they make up the majority of tech? If you think about it, wouldn’t<br>it be more logical to conclude that there are also other factors at play —<br>such as gender/racial biases, feeling unwelcome in tech, and some races being<br>statistically more likely to be disadvantaged than others?</p>
<p>Lastly, whether or not the majority thinks “my group is underrepresented in<br>tech so hire me though I’m not qualified” is the right way to go (and how do<br>you know that’s true; where are your statistics?) — I don’t care. My opinion<br>here is that no one gets a free pass. Everyone has to work hard if they want<br>to succeed. But what you’re failing to recognize here is that it’s not a level<br>playing field. It’s not true that everyone has completely equal chances of<br>succeeding, and that if someone doesn’t succeed it’s always because they<br>didn’t work hard enough, and never because of other factors. I’m not devaluing<br>hard work. I’m saying that we need to acknowledge these inequities exist and<br>take steps to solve them, so that every person’s hard work can be properly and<br>fairly recognized.</p>
<p>Student:<br>It’s clear that your definition of a successful society is very narrow and<br>shows your limited worldview. When you have people who all come from the same<br>background and all think the same way, how can you expect them to truly<br>understand the other 90% of the world? When they choose the kinds of products<br>and services to design and implement, when they decide what is necessary to be<br>created to improve society, naturally they will only relate to their own<br>experiences, like you are doing right now, and use them as basis to form<br>judgments of what technology should be created and how society should operate.<br>Japan, although strong economically and in tech, still cannot compare to the<br>innovation of diverse America and will never come close to the worldwide<br>impact of America with only homogeneous and singular views. If you want<br>technology that only benefits a specific group of people and doesn’t fully<br>consider the needs of others, continue with your fixed mindset that the world<br>will never be equal and that diversity is useless and doesn’t contribute to a<br>successful society. It’s pitiful that you’ve adopted such a pessimistic and<br>narrow-minded view.</p>
<p>“If they want to do tech, then do tech.” Again, you’re ignoring all of the<br>social factors that discourage people from even wanting to do tech in the<br>first place. And even when they decide tech is something worth their time to<br>pursue a career in, they face obstacles that pull them away from the field.<br>Which you should perceive as a bad thing, unless you’re still stuck to the<br>ideology that diversity is useless.</p>
<p>Student:<br>There’s little to no evidence to suggest that racial diversity is necessary or<br>better for tech or society in general. Japan is one of the most homogeneous<br>countries in the world, but have one of the largest economies and leads in<br>science and discovery. Nobody is asking women to go into medicine or nursing.<br>If they want to do tech, then do tech. You people have to stop being special<br>snowflakes and accept that the world isn’t equal. And yes, it’s a sick<br>narrative, because it doesn’t exist.</p>
<p>Student:<br>The fact that she’s succeeded only STRENGTHENS her argument. What is there to<br>complain about if she’s successful? That should mean there’s no problems, and<br>everything is fine, right? Wrong… so wrong.</p>
<p>Women face biases all the time. Immediately, when you see a female in tech,<br>especially a stereotypically attractive and feminine woman, you judge that<br>she’s less competent than a man. Intelligence and competence are highly<br>associated with masculinity. Beauty and brains don’t go together. When girls<br>grow up, they feel this pressure all the time–the pressure to choose between<br>being beautiful and being smart. Our society still objectifies women and<br>attaches their physical beauty to their value as people, more so than men. And<br>this is made worse by the relative lack of female leaders and role models in<br>tech. Girls grow up thinking they don’t belong in tech, and this is why they<br>choose other, more stereotypically feminine careers such as medicine or<br>nursing, over tech. This is why there are programs to encourage females to<br>stay in tech. Because technology plays such a large role in defining how our<br>society works, and diverse perspectives are needed to help shape society.</p>
<p>Please open your mind to perspectives and experiences that aren’t yours. It’s<br>not bullshit or some “sick narrative of victimhood.” The statistics showing<br>the lack of diversity in tech aren’t bullshit. If you agree that no one gender<br>or race should dominate any single field, then be supportive of attempts to<br>integrate varying perspectives into tech. No one is hurting your ability to<br>succeed in your tech career away by encouraging others, who didn’t grow up<br>with parents or friends or role models in tech, to consider tech.</p>
<p>Student:<br>The fact that you have succeeded as a Physics and CS major detracts from your<br>argument. You are probably already in the top 1% of Berkeley students. You can<br>play the victim card all you want, it’s the popular thing to do nowadays. I<br>will never be convinced that you, because you are a woman, have been<br>significantly affected because of it. Is there sexism and racism? Of course,<br>but I’m not convinced that here in the Bay Area, it’s this huge problem.<br>There’s this notion that minorities, women, have it so bad, worse than other<br>genders or races. It’s just not true.</p>
<p>“I am not, as OP is saying, “complaining ‘my group is underrepresented in tech<br>so hire me though I’m not qualified’”” That’s a load of BS. If you look<br>around, you will see that’s exactly what they (the majority) want.</p>
<p>There’s really no point continuing this argument. You and all the others here<br>have swallowed the sick narrative of victimhood, and I don’t blame you, the<br>recent election must have really gotten a lot of people on the edge. But he<br>wasn’t elected because of racism or biases, he was elected because of things<br>like this sick narrative of victimhood. But keep pushing it! It worked so well<br>last time.</p>
<p>To all the current students who feel disenfranchised here, whether you be<br>white or Asian or something else, I sympathize with you. Just remember to vote<br>in the next election. if you think these people have your interests in mind,<br>forget it. Remember these people want to kick you out because of you work too<br>hard. Your hard work doesn’t matter. Asians aren’t diverse. Poor whites are<br>privileged. For our vendetta we can only hope that Trump gets reelected.</p>

<p>Student:<br>Professor, thank you for taking the time to personally respond to this thread.<br>It shows how world-class EECS faculty members are. They make you suffer a lot<br>to make you learn but students grow stronger due to it. So thanks.</p>
<p>Professor, please do consider teaching CS 288 in the near future! We are all<br>dying to learn Natural Language Processing. I saw your enthusiasm while<br>teaching language translation at the end of CS 61A. I would give my right<br>kidney to take CS 288 with you.</p>

<h3 id="Followup-125"><a href="#Followup-125" class="headerlink" title="Followup:"></a>Followup:</h3><p>Student:<br>Several thoughts @ latest anon:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sure, you might get to argue the merits of Aristotle’s vs Kant’s views of<br>morality…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It doesn’t seem like you’ve taken an ethics course! Engineering ethics aren’t<br>frequently taught in abstract utilitarianism/deontology debates (especially<br>those as anachronistic as Aristotle &amp; Kant), but rather via more recent<br>scholarship and various case studies. CS 195, for example, does a great job of<br>this.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…but does that make you a good person?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a straw-person argument. Nobody (in this thread or otherwise) is<br>making the claim that requiring an understanding of ethics makes everyone good<br>people automatically––clearly even engineers who understand ethics can and do<br>make unethical decisions.</p>
<p>Ethics courses offer a combination of frameworks (e.g.<br>deontological/utilitarian thought) and postmortems that are helpful for people<br>who want to be good. When we, in our careers, ask ourselves “am I making the<br>ethical decision? am I a <em>good person</em> if I build this tool?, “ ethics<br>requirements will have built the skills necessary to answer those questions to<br>our own satisfaction. Feel free to make the claim that this thinking is<br>trivial and can be achieved via some good ol’ fashioned engineering<br>intuition––the thousands of years of moral philosophy you cite, an extremely<br>dense recent interest in STEM ethics (esp. bioethics), and various ongoing<br>violations of ethical standards in STEM indicate otherwise</p>
<p>Whatever “good” means, that is.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If that was the case, politicians across America would be scrambling to<br>offer this magic solution to their criminals.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a red herring. Ethics classes exist to make engineering students more<br>ethical engineers; if whatever “criminals” you’re referring to are engineering<br>students (they very well might be), then engineering ethics classes make a lot<br>of sense for them!</p>
<p>Furthermore, even if we take your extension as valid/logical, there are lots<br>of programs teaching moral philosophy and ethics in American prisons as part<br>of rehabilitation/education programs.</p>
<p>And, finally, since when are politicians experts on engineering ethics? Why do<br>you defer to their authority? This impulse seems misguided, especially given<br>the various violations of engineering ethics that have been and continue to be<br>commissioned by a number of governments.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You want more ethical people, I get it, but my point is forcing someone to<br>take a ethics class defeats the point.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, it is good when people are ethical. Is your argument that exposing people<br>to ethics will cause them to be unethical? That it’ll have no impact on their<br>personal ethics? You haven’t indicated either, even in your fallacious<br>comparison.</p>
<p>Student:<br>I don’t think taking an ethics course makes someone a better person per se.<br>Sure, you might get to argue the merits of Aristotle’s vs Kant’s views of<br>morality but does that really make you a good person? No. Making someone a<br>good person isn’t as simple as having them take a class. If that was the case,<br>politicians across America would be scrambling to offer this magic solution to<br>their criminals. You want more ethical people, I get it, but my point is<br>forcing someone to take a ethics class defeats the point.</p>

<p>Student:<br>+1</p>
<p>Thank you Chonyi, I hope that what you’ve mentioned materializes into concrete<br>action items from the department’s end &amp; are institutionalized with a<br>transparent timeline.</p>
<p>From my experience as serving as an ASUC senator, the fact of the matter is<br>that student’s come and go, they graduate, we graduate - but the one constant<br>that will always remain is the Department, the one constant that can be shaped<br>to reflect the impact &amp; culture that we want to have lies in the Department<br>which has a large role in our education from inside &amp; outside the classroom.<br>The Department is in a position to implement these ideas that Chonyi has<br>mentioned, we have dedicated roles within the administration to spearhead<br>these issues - when can we begin?</p>
<p>Student:<br>and since this is such a common sentiment and we have already recognized that<br>people are not content with the current climate, I think it makes sense for<br>the department to take some responsibility in educating people within the<br>department because these people largely contribute to the climate.</p>
<h3 id="Followup-126"><a href="#Followup-126" class="headerlink" title="Followup:"></a>Followup:</h3><p>Student:<br>Merhdad is right about the fact that the goal here is to correct systemic and<br>historical biases. But, I think the goal of programs directed at certain<br>individuals go beyond affirmative action practices.</p>
<p>When I said it removes tensions, I meant in the context of that particular<br>environment, not across society. However, I sincerely doubt that these<br>programs do increase racial, economic or other divides in a meaningful way.<br>Why is OK to group ‘disadvantaged’ into one large group or to not consider<br>race? I would agree that socioeconomic status is probably a better indicator<br>of disadvantage, but it’s so intertwined with race, that I don’t think it<br>matters much in aggregate.</p>
<p>But furthermore, ‘disadvantaged’ is a catch-all term, like marginalized that<br>captures dozens and dozens of different disadvantages. While the blind and<br>visually impaired have instances of discrimination and microaggressions,<br>they’re not same struggles that black youth, or Latinxs, or any other group<br>face, even though they’re in a similar category.</p>
<p>Specific programs give people a place to share and grow and hopefully include<br>support without the discomfort of needing to explain to others the struggles<br>they’ve encountered. For example, while I would to teach CS at many of them,<br>my presence would be an active distraction for many of the students.  </p>
<p>If as a society, we segregated ourselves all the time, in every way, then<br>you’re right that’d we probably be in a worse position overall. But programs<br>that address a specific group aren’t designed to replace people’s interaction<br>with others - they’re a temporary. Someone who goes through an internship<br>targeted at women, will almost certainly be working with and interacting with<br>and possibly even dating men then or in the future. Additionally, people are<br>intersectional, I don’t believe that individuals in these programs see<br>themselves as only that adjective.</p>
<p>Finally– the the quote “people don’t see race”. People absolutely notice<br>people who don’t look or act like them. It doesn’t matter whether you think<br>you’re an enlightened person; we all have unconscious biases we are (by<br>definition) we are unaware of. What do you think when you walk by a homeless<br>person, or see a group of African American dancers on BART, or someone using a<br>red and white cane, etc, etc? Some of these things you and I probably think<br>are normal, but for some of them we have instinctive reactions we probably<br>don’t even notice. It’s very difficult to become aware of these things, but<br>damn, I’ve carried around some very ill-conceived thoughts and reactions.</p>
<p>Student:<br>@^Anon: Affirmative action is not aimed at the individual, or at the present<br>for that matter.</p>
<p>What a <em>lot</em> of people seem to miss is the fact that the point of affirmative<br>action is to attempt to compensate for <em>historical</em> , systematic<br>oppression/discrimination against a people. The idea is, when you oppress a<br>group of people for hundreds of years and then realize you’ve been doing<br>something morally wrong, you can’t just stop, apologize, and then pretend as<br>if that is sufficient to right your wrong… you actually need to compensate.<br>This may or may not involve some intermediate effects such as increasing<br>diversity or helping the needy/poor, and one might argue those are themselves<br>noble goals worth pursuing, but they are side effects, not the goals<br>themselves here. The goal is to right a historical moral wrong, and its scope<br>and effects extend beyond individuals or the current generation. If the<br>present was similar but the history wasn’t there, affirmative action could<br>very well not be there either.</p>
<p>Student:<br>Michael, thank you for writing such a detailed answer.</p>
<p>I would disagree that the programs you mention remove racial/gender/economic<br>tensions. They increase them. People don’t usually look at people based on<br>their race but when you divide people into groups like this, and give specific<br>groups opportunities, then you interracial anger that never even existed in<br>the first place. There should be special programs for the disadvantaged in<br>general, so dividing along economic lines is fine, however let’s not make<br>assumptions like “he’s a Latino student, hence we need to help him out instead<br>of this poor white student”.</p>
<p>Student:<br>Ok to the questions:</p>
<p>Edit: mixing up my piazza posts. lol. Just like the ol’ days.</p>
<p>Perverse Incentives to Lie.</p>
<p>I like to think of this the same way I deal with cheating as a TA/Instructor.<br>My experience is that most people don’t cheat, and most cheating doesn’t tip<br>the scales in a significant way. Regardless of whether you add race or gender<br>to the mix, what we’re talking about is people cheating an application system.<br>People can (and do) do this already. However, the question is about prevalence<br>and the how effective the cheating is. Most people don’t lie, and those who do<br>lie about their race or socioeconomic status or fabricate essays for college<br>were probably not as strong of applicants to being with. I also very much<br>fundamentally believe that most people are well intentioned and not evil. That<br>helps me stay grounded at times..because:</p>
<p>People lying to gain an advantage is a real problem. Turns out, for a nominal<br>sum of cash (say $1500) it’s pretty easy to get certified as having ADHD.<br>Aside from the access to prescription drugs, this enables people to unfairly<br>apply for disability accommodations. 150% time on a test can certainly be an<br>advantage when you’re not using it to overcome a disability. The result of<br>this, is that getting accommodations can be excessively difficult. It took<br>nearly a year (and letters and phone calls from my parents to many people at<br>the College Board) to get approved, and they still eff’d up my SATs and AP<br>tests many times.  </p>
<p>So, the consequences of these actions are real. To me, the solution is that if<br>you find someone is lying or cheating, you punish them. When it comes to race<br>(and even more so, gender identity) is can be difficult and touchy to verify,<br>but if a company has a problem that is so bad to the point where they need to<br>take these measures, I think they can communicate with applicants about their<br>process. I would much rather see process try to adapt to be equitable, and<br>then correct their mistakes instead of trying nothing at all. In my view: if<br>an application asks for a gender, and it’s progressive enough to even include<br>an option for transgender, I just can’t fathom that many people (I just say<br>it…) are fucked up enough to co-opt the incredible struggles of the trans<br>community for their own gain? I’m not saying it won’t happen, but until it<br>happens on a big scale, I personally think the impact that you make by being<br>equitable would outweigh the potential costs.</p>
<p>However, the other option is to change the incentive structure. Getting a job<br>will always have a high financial incentive to it, but I think it just means<br>that we have to adjust the process to lower the stakes. I read that the<br>average American now has 10 jobs before they’re 40. This hopefully means that<br>landing in the wrong first job won’t be such a deal. It’s part education and<br>part process change that I think can ultimately solve the problems.  </p>
<p>On programs that are only for a certain race or group:<br>I don’t personally have strong feelings about these overall. My personal<br>belief is that the more we interact with others not like us, the more we will<br>collectively understand each other better. However, programs that cater to a<br>specific demographic and be extremely successful. In the space on early-CS<br>education there are a number of programs such as CODE2040, Black Girls Code,<br>AppCamp for Girls, Level the Playing Field Institute. These programs are, in<br>part, able to achieve success by simply removing the racial, gender, economic<br>and other tensions so so they can focus on their goals of teaching<br>programming. In think internship and scholarship programs that are structured<br>the same way are also a necessary component of progress. They give people<br>opportunities they otherwise wouldn’t have. And in terms of resources, I don’t<br>think those programs typically take away spots from everyone else - I think<br>they’re more of an additive thing. Like “we’re going to do this extra effort<br>because we believe in this case”, such that if not centered around a<br>gender/ethic/etc issue, then there wouldn’t be a replacement program.</p>
<p>Student:<br><em>The last section that was cut off:</em></p>
<p>It’s possible, in fact I’d say extremely likely, almost certain, that the<br>resource allocation is biassed towards the majority. This isn’t necessarily<br>nefarious, more a byproduct of societal and system imbalances. It’s true that<br>there may be some “give and take” in terms of what needs to change to be<br>better supportive of more groups and individuals. We are all (or were)<br>struggling college students and trying to get into classes. The unfortunate<br>reality is that some groups experience disadvantages that others do not. You<br>can claim this is natural, and to an extent you’d be right. However, what’s<br>not natural are the extreme gender and racial imbalances in our program (and<br>others). What’s not natural, is recognizing that discrimination exists, but<br>ignoring to do anything about it.  </p>
<p>What’s different about the issues now, is that there are a critical mass of a<br>bunch of different marginalized groups. Keep in mind that not everyone at<br>these town halls and social hours is experiencing the same struggles and<br>difficulties. It’s a wide range of issues, but there are very common unifying<br>elements that I believe demand the attention of everyone in our community.<br>While I was not at this town hall, I was at the one immediately prior, and so<br>far these have been the two best attended town halls in my recent memory. The<br>have been better attended by faculty, staff, students, and administrators.<br>There were a couple years not too long ago where the department didn’t have a<br>town hall because attendance was so low.</p>
<p>Finally, I wanted to reiterate that these topics are tough and I truly mean<br>that my inbox is open if you’d like to send a message.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading. &lt;3.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>Follow Up:</p>
<p>It was brought to me that my comparison to advocating for diverse political<br>view points on campus is an unfair comparison. I was not trying to convey nor<br>imply that those with traditionally conservative viewpoints have faced the<br>system biases that other marginalized groups have. That’s not fair comparison.<br>I was trying to convey that we ought to have diversity in many ways. People<br>are intersectional - “the isms” cross many different boundaries that can apply<br>to people in many ways. We need to make sure that those who are not like us,<br>are included in our communities.</p>
<p>Student:<br>Also, Michael, how would you suggest we deal with people lying about their<br>race to gain advantage in tech? This has been happening in university<br>admissions for a while and also in politics (see Elizabeth Warren). Based on<br>the increasing advantages being a minority student in tech holds today, just<br>based on recruiters actively reaching out to you, the incentive to lie about<br>one’s race is growing.</p>
<p>Student:<br>Michael, thank you for your post. You mentioned tech companies are reaching<br>out to minority groups more, which is great. What are your thoughts on<br>internship / job programs that only accept minority students, however. Some<br>internship programs are reserved for minority students, just based on their<br>race, which is a large cause of the anger felt by the OP and others.</p>

<h3 id="Anant-Sahai’s-answer-99"><a href="#Anant-Sahai’s-answer-99" class="headerlink" title="Anant Sahai’s answer"></a>Anant Sahai’s answer</h3><p>Different town halls have focused on different topics. Think about it<br>logically. If the department wanted to understand the full breadth and scope<br>of student concerns, and wanted to do so over the course of multiple town<br>halls, then what would be a better strategy?</p>
<p>A) Having each town hall be completely open and free-form as to topic, thereby<br>getting lots of people voicing the same issues over and over again.</p>
<p>B) Having a general town hall, student surveys, followed by topic-specific<br>town hall meetings so that a broader scope of student concerns can be heard.</p>
<p>(Optional technical exercise: in what ways is this like or unlike the use of<br>linear vs nonlinear signaling for communicating over a noisy channel? If you<br>get to use a noisy channel repeatedly to communicate a single Gaussian random<br>variable, how does the performance scale with linear approaches? What scaling<br>can you get with nonlinear approaches?)</p>
<p>The issue of course offerings and increasing the TA budget have already been<br>discussed. There are things being done trying to resolve this and<br>fundamentally, those are about getting campus to give faculty slots and TA<br>money to the department. Inclusivity, on the other hand, is incredibly<br>important and had not been discussed nearly enough. EECS values inclusion.<br>Language like “victim card” and the like might seem like mere rhetorical<br>flourishes to some of you, but such language and behavior acts as a way to<br>exclude many people. Humans have feelings and are social creatures.<br>Exclusion/inclusion is not some third-order effect for systems of interacting<br>humans.</p>
<p>(Optional technical exercise, in case simple decency of being inclusive isn’t<br>enough: when one is designing a control system that has multiple state<br>dimensions and dynamics that couple them, is the optimal control strategy<br>going to be to only consider the dimension of the state that you care about?<br>Why or why not?)</p>
<p>The rigor of thinking that the EECS department wishes to inculcate in its<br>students is not limited to questions involving software or circuits or devices<br>or mathematical models that we give you. The goal is for you to be able to<br>think critically and rigorously about problems in general. One of the<br>important principles here is not assuming that everyone else is a fool. It’s<br>alright to not understand something. That’s normal. You might question<br>something because it doesn’t make sense to you. That’s also good. But to jump<br>from there to assume that the people in charge are in the grips of something<br>nefarious like “Political Correctness” isn’t logical. It’s arrogant.<br><em>Humility</em> is a vital attribute for engineers. Approach questions sincerely.<br><em>Arrogance</em> can be fatal in practice.</p>
<p>It is good that you appreciate your TAs. And it is good that you have high<br>esteem for your faculty. But you should also have some trust that these same<br>good TAs and faculty are trying to achieve something when we want to<br>understand how to improve inclusivity. Just because you have not experienced<br>something doesn’t mean that it does not exist.</p>

The<br>pacing in 70 is admittedly a bit fast — we expect students to actually skim<br>notes ahead of lecture, attend lecture (paying attention and taking notes) and<br>participate actively in discussions, go back and reread notes carefully, and<br>then attack the homework problems with full dedication (not while<br>multitasking) and working through their confusion, possibly with the help of<br>interacting with other students.

<h3 id="Followup-128"><a href="#Followup-128" class="headerlink" title="Followup:"></a>Followup:</h3><p>Student:<br>Btw Adhikari said she is NOT planning to replace 134 with 140. This is because<br>134 is better suited for someone without a programming/Data 8 background.</p>
<p>Student:<br>reading for stat140 right now (after have taking 134). The probability you<br>learn is pretty equivalent, but you also learn a bit of numpy/scipy stats to<br>do simulations or calculate probabilities you wouldn’t be able to do on pencil<br>and paper.</p>
<p>stat140 has a lab section which 134 does not have, so that could be a<br>consideration in differentiating the courses</p>
<p>in terms of probability overlap between 70 and 134/140, i would agree with the<br>student answer. i took 70 and 134 the same semester and it was a lot of help<br>to already be familiar with probability by the time 70 got to it.</p>
<p>Student:<br>Prof. Adhikari is also the current 134 Professor.</p>
<p>Student:<br>Tbh 140 and 134 are supposed to be very directly comparable; Adhikari (current<br>140 prof and frequent 134 prof) says that’s it’s the same material and intends<br>to replace 134 with 140 permanently within the near future. She has said the<br>only difference is the ability to use Python to simulate events and calculate<br>things that are intractable by hand. Plus, course readings/practice problems<br>all come from Pitman. I doubt anybody can say for sure exactly how much<br>they’re the same, as nobody can take both, but I’d suspect they’re pretty darn<br>similar.</p>
<p>As for relevance to 70, pretty much all the probability notes in 70 have<br>already been taught in 140.</p>

<p>Summer policy has not been set. But not attending lecture in summer is an even<br>worse idea than not attending lecture during the semester. In summer,<br>everything is going twice as fast. You’re not expected to be able to take any<br>more than a single course at a time.</p>
<h2 id="Inadequacy-after-learning-concepts"><a href="#Inadequacy-after-learning-concepts" class="headerlink" title="Inadequacy after learning concepts"></a>Inadequacy after learning concepts</h2><p>2017-01-23<br>After learning most concepts, I feel inadequate because I know in the real<br>world, they’re not using this concept: They’re using something much more<br>sophisticated.</p>
<p>For example, Error Correcting Codes (CS 70): The ECCs we learn were discovered<br>in the 1970s. Today’s ECCs use much more complex techniques involving abstract<br>algebra.</p>
<p>Why learn these basic concepts if in the real world, I’ll need to use<br>something much more complex? And knowing the basic case won’t help me (I’ll<br>need to learn abstract algebra which this approach doesn’t require)</p>
<h3 id="Anant-Sahai’s-answer-104"><a href="#Anant-Sahai’s-answer-104" class="headerlink" title="Anant Sahai’s answer"></a>Anant Sahai’s answer</h3><p>The basics are what are the most important over a long career. You need to<br>understand the core idea of something before you can understand other<br>manifestations of the idea as well as extensions. EECS courses aren’t<br>cookbooks with recipes for you to follow. And in the lower-division at least,<br>many things are taught to you in a way that does double or triple duty — you<br>are not just being taught about X, but also how to think more generally, as<br>well as learning ideas that are more broadly applicable.</p>
<p>For error correcting codes themselves, EE229B talks about them in more detail<br>and brings you closer to the state of the art. This is not to say that the<br>codes taught in 70 aren’t useful today — many modern implementations take<br>the ideas of Reed Solomon codes taught in 70 and make things more efficient by<br>exploiting ideas of extension fields (taught in EE229B and Math 114 I<br>believe). There are also other qualitatively distinct code families, namely<br>the polar codes, LDPC codes, and turbo codes, that are increasingly popular<br>today in cutting-edge applications. To understand LDPC and Turbo code<br>constructions and implementations, you need to understand more about message-<br>passing inference algorithms as well as things like linear programming and<br>optimization. To understand polar codes, you need more information theory<br>(EE229A) as well. These modern families build more directly on the material in<br><em>core</em> EECS courses like 126, 127, etc. rather than on the algebra and<br>algebraic geometry underlying other codes in the Reed Solomon style.</p>
<p>Remember, a Bachelor’s degree gives you the education you need to be an<br>apprentice that learns on the job, and can keep on learning for the next 4+<br>decades. It cannot make you a master at anything without sacrificing your<br>long-term future for an ephemeral gain in the present. Lower-division is<br>designed to help you build a solid foundation to prepare you for <em>learning</em><br>more advanced material.</p>

So I looked back on the structure of EE147<br>and found that it had 3 hours of lectures and 1 hour of discussion weekly,<br>which was exactly the same as most of 4-unit CS upper divs. The amount of<br>workload was, at least to me, same as the other 4-unit classes.

<p>For example, CS 70 and EE 126 give you the tools (Markov Chains, Expectation,<br>etc) to model a lot of real world phenomena. On the other hand, Math 54 is<br>really theoretical: Vector spaces, basis, rank, null space. Math 54 is useful<br>but only in EE 16A did I appreciate linear algebra.</p>

Before that, I thought I should properly<br>understand what ML actually IS. I help lead Machine Learning at Berkeley and<br>currently research in Prof. Wagner’s lab. I’ve also published several papers<br>on deep learning. Over the summer, I interned on Google’s self driving car<br>team. But I never truly grasped what ML is. So I present this question, which<br>has been eating at me for months.</p>
<p>If machines can learn, why can’t they teach? Why can’t they think? Reason?<br>Worship? Why are we focusing on Machine LEARNING instead all of these other<br>possibilities? A machine that can think is far more intelligent than one that<br>can simply learn. So we should be focusing on that instead.</p>

<p>Our research perspective infuses all the courses, but in ways that are<br>sometimes too subtle for the as yet untrained eye to perceive. (Faculty who<br>visit from elsewhere often give us comments though, because they can see what<br>we are doing underneath the surface that you perceive.) For example, 16AB were<br>literally put together with cutting-edge research in mind (and new ways were<br>developed research-style for the course itself), and the goal of innoculating<br>students with the right patterns of thought to be able to participate and<br>absorb the things that are coming down the pike. Not just 16AB — some of the<br>problems in CS70 as well are abstracted from ideas that arose in research<br>contexts. DS8 is the same way. However, the connections between the research<br>and the problems are sometimes obscured because the first duty of homework and<br>lecture is to be digestible by students and help them grow (even if this<br>growth sometimes leaves you a bit sore).</p>
<p>The connections to research become slightly more visible in upper-division<br>courses like 126, 127, 121, 123, 189, etc… (To speak about a few that I<br>directly know about.) They are quite visible in graduate courses and<br>completely out in the open in special topics courses (like the 194/294 course<br>I will teach next semester).</p>
<p>But as in all fields, there is a difference in perspective between a master<br>and one who is beginning their education. Senior musicians and dancers will<br>often go on and on about the importance of the foundations, because their<br>mastery gives them a different perspective on the basics than the beginner<br>has. It is no different in Engineering. That is why a high degree of faith and<br>trust in your instructors is so important in education.</p>
<p>Anyway, the fastest way to get access to a bit of the feel of the integration<br>between research and teaching in the lower division is to join the content<br>team for a course. There, you will see things more in the open as well.</p>

<p>Kris Pister:<br>Your point is a good one. Prof. Sahai correctly explained out that our<br>research and startup experiences have a big</p>
<p>impact on what and how we teach, but to your point we may not be doing a good<br>job of pointing that out during</p>
<p>lecture. Often a short comment or parenthetical clause is all that it takes,<br>but I think that sometimes the faculty</p>
<p>forget to do that.</p>
<p>I always try to throw references like that into my lectures and course<br>material. If you take ee140 from me, you’ll do</p>
<p>your CMOS designs for the fictional startup Golden Bear Circuits, and you’ll<br>have a clear startup-relevant chip design task straight</p>

<p>In addition to going to office hours to ask questions, I would encourage you<br>to ask questions in lecture periodically</p>
<p>as well, either before or during class, about how what you are learning is<br>related to research and commercial practice.</p>

This is one of the major reasons that 16A and 16B were<br>built the way they are. The student answer is pretty good, to which I can just<br>add that the discussion of the spectral theorem (eigenvalues/eigenvectors for<br>symmetric matrices) and the SVD in 16B is also relevant. For EECS people,<br>linear-algebra is not just a bag of tools. It is an important component of how<br>we think.</p>
<p>The idea is that 16B + hard work should get people to where they need to be.<br>Math 54 by itself is not enough for most.</p>

<p>Student:<br>(not Garrett but) Basically the more you do math / proofs / challenging<br>problems the more mathematically mature you get. Think of it as math<br>intuition. It’s something that’s not really taught, but it’s something you<br>gain by studying more math.</p>

I think you should take it with Shewchuk<br>though… just reading his notes on it give me a good impression of the way he<br>taught the class.</p>
<p>Yeah I had Prof. Recht last semester. The class was really interesting, but to<br>be quite blunt, it was the most disorganized CS class (or maybe just class in<br>general) I’ve ever taken. Most people had to rely on student’s notes or<br>Shewchuk’s notes because nothing was easy to find, lectures were in general<br>kinda hard to understand and a little too simplistic at times. Idk if the TAs<br>or the profs made the exams, but the midterm was brutal, and the final was<br>pretty tough too (although imo way easier).</p>
<p>Student:<br>Who’s better, Hug or Shewshuck for ML?</p>
<p>Also, were you get rekt by Prof. Rect?</p>
<p>Student:<br>Different offerings of the course have different emphases on math. Fall 2016<br>was more mathy because the professors (specifically Prof. Recht) believed that<br>CS 189 = EE 126 + EE 127 + some notes on backprop, which is ultimately just a<br>bunch of math.</p>
<p>If you take it next semester with Shewchuk, I believe you’ll have a bit of a<br>different experience. There is still def. alot of math, but I think the ML<br>concepts are emphasized more.</p>
<p>Student:<br>@Anon from 3 replies ago. Idk, that’s a question for you. You signed up for<br>this major, so you must of had your reasons, right? I’m not sure how it didn’t<br>dawn on you from 70, 170, and 188 that cs is a mathy discipline. At this point<br>you just sound bitter.</p>
<p>Student:<br>Well, I like the mathy aspects of ML, but I like coding and software<br>engineering too.</p>
<p>Student:<br>yeah, exactly - that’s my point.</p>
<p>Student:<br>lol tons of CS PhDs working in the AMPLab are math undergrads.</p>
<p>Student:<br>What’s the point of studying Computer Science then? Why don’t we all just<br>study math?</p>

<p>I think the reverse is definitely true though - I took 110 before 189 and felt<br>that it helped me immensely.

I need some advice: <strong>How to perform</strong> <strong>above average on<br>exams.</strong> In all my technical classes here, I ‘m always</p>
<p>+- .5 STDs from the mean. Consequently, I’m a solid B student.</p>
<p>No matter how hard I study, I always perform around the same. The problem is<br>that I’m not studying the right way. There’s always problems on the final I<br>just don’t know how to do. <strong>I ‘m not mastering the material</strong> like I should.</p>
<p><em><strong>How should I be studying?</strong></em></p>
<p>This is what I do currently.<br>1. Write down everything I need to know.<br>2. Re-do all discussion WSs, cross off items.<br>3. Practice weak areas from old exams.<br>4. Do (untimed) practice exams.</p>
<p>I’m taking 61C and 170 next semester. I’d especially appreciate if Yujie,<br>Steven Bi and other TAs replied.</p>
<h3 id="Anant-Sahai’s-answer-108"><a href="#Anant-Sahai’s-answer-108" class="headerlink" title="Anant Sahai’s answer"></a>Anant Sahai’s answer</h3><p>Student posters, do you do old exams timed or untimed? Whole thing at once, or<br>question by question with answer key?</p>
<p>From Prof. Sahai:</p>
<p>1) The most important thing to remember is that everone is different in how<br>they learn, but the most direct path to doing well on exams is to actually<br>understand the material well, understand how it connects to everything else<br>that you have learned, and to have sufficient practice with the underlying<br>technical skills to be able to execute on demand.</p>
<p>2) For many students, getting adequate sleep and rest is extremely important.<br>Relatedly, the general ability to concentrate and not be distracted for three<br>hours straight is really important. So, don’t shoot yourself in the foot by<br>going into sleep debt, not eating properly, or allowing yourself to cultivate<br>habits of distraction. Being able to do one thing at a tiMaking your own me<br>for a long time isn’t something that will just work on exams when you’ve spent<br>all the time earlier in 3 minute work bursts interrupted by texts, youtube<br>videos, etc… Marathoners don’t train by just doing sprints.</p>
<p>3) Don’t try to learn everything at the last minute. Really try to understand<br>everything as the homeworks flow week by week. Don’t just assume that you’ll<br>understand things better later. Ask the TAs and Profs for help earlier rather<br>than later.</p>
<p>4) In furtherance of your underlying understanding, the following approaches<br>are woefully underused:</p>
<ul>
<li>Making your own problems about the material, solving them, and sharing them with others.</li>
<li>It is often said that the best way to really learn something is to teach it. So, in general, doing versions of what the TAs and Profs do is a good idea. Make your own exam. Think about the concepts in the course, how they connect to other material in prereq courses and follow-on courses (ask your TAs or Prof if you do not understand this), and then try to make questions that hit those connections. After doing the practice exams as practice, deconstruct the problems and ask how you could make a similar question yourself? </li>
<li>Pretend you are inside the material and understand how it fits together from the perspective of the computer or the math itself. Engage your artistic and imaginative side: try to escape the bounds of your individual human experience by stretching your ability to identify with the subject. Don’t be afraid to be silly. And don’t be cynical — every time you are cynical, you are just putting emotional distance between yourself and the material. That is not going to help you. The material has to become like a close friend — you can get mad at it and frustrated at times, but you have to let yourself care and be vulnerable if you are going to really get close.</li>
<li>Play “stump your friend” with someone you care about and trust — test each other about the material in a way that helps them understand better but don’t destroy their confidence. If you end up stumping yourself, this is fine. Figure it out together. </li>
<li>Don’t be restricted to what you can see on the computer screen. Print stuff out and write stuff out by hand. Lay out the material in your own way so that it spatially spans many pages and you can see it all together spread out around you. The computer screen is too small to fully engage your visual memory.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Followup-147"><a href="#Followup-147" class="headerlink" title="Followup:"></a>Followup:</h3><p>Student:<br>a. Try to learn the week’s material over the weekend, before the week starts.</p>
<p>b. If there is a textbook or recommended supplement, read it because it will<br>be helpful. Just going over the lecture slides is not enough…</p>
<p>Hope these help :)</p>
<p>Student:<br>Not OP but for b, if material is harder to consume and understand, it will<br>“stick” more and you’ll end up understanding it better. When someone is making<br>concepts clear and easy to understand, its easy to fool yourself into thinking<br>you’ve learned them.</p>
<h3 id="Followup-148"><a href="#Followup-148" class="headerlink" title="Followup:"></a>Followup:</h3><p>Student:<br>Also, sometimes it helps to learn or know some of the material beforehand. You<br>still have a month.</p>
<p>Student:<br>By going to lectures / discussions? They take only a few hours…</p>
<p>And asking yourself the question: “How much of your ‘studying’ time are you<br>actually studying?”</p>
<p>I’m sometimes shocked by the answer myself lol…</p>
<h3 id="Followup-149"><a href="#Followup-149" class="headerlink" title="Followup:"></a>Followup:</h3><p>Student:<br>I think that the listing of the sorts of activities that are useful to do on a<br>regular basis (e.g. actually reviewing the solutions to previous homeworks<br>instead of just being satisfied with getting full points on a problem, first<br>trying the homework on your own for a few hours and <em>then</em> work on the<br>problems with your study group) is more useful than the actual time allotted<br>for each of the activities.</p>
<p>That is, scale the numbers down if you want, but the list of activities is<br>pretty reasonable.</p>
<p>Student:<br>I think this probably is a little much… I don’t know anyone who actually<br>spends this much time on a single class consistently</p>
<p>Student:<br>Sure, that’s more or less the same idea as the answer above.</p>
<h3 id="Followup-150"><a href="#Followup-150" class="headerlink" title="Followup:"></a>Followup:</h3><p>Student:<br>I noted above the suggestion of first trying studying alone, and then meeting<br>with your group, when you’ve already tried some ideas (whether or not they<br>work). See if your groupmates had the same ideas, and brainstorm more together<br>if none of them work.</p>
<p>But if you’re pretending that you understand something when in your group,<br>then that’s probably not going to be very effective / a separate problem to<br>handle (e.g. if it’s a confidence/embarrassment issue).</p>
<p>Student:<br>Also when studying alone, your mileage may vary. When studying in a group,<br>some people will ask questions that will really test the extent of your<br>knowledge. If you don’t think you can get that kind of coverage on your own,<br>study in a group.</p>
<h3 id="Followup-151"><a href="#Followup-151" class="headerlink" title="Followup:"></a>Followup:</h3><p>Student:<br>Not particularly, he got a B in CS 61A.</p>
<p>Student:<br>is he a CS God?</p>
<p>Student:<br>I think when you sleep and get up is completely irrelevant to your grade as<br>long as you get enough sleep… I know someone who got an A in CS 70 who slept<br>at 6 am every day during dead week (and got up at like 2 pm).</p>
<h3 id="Followup-152"><a href="#Followup-152" class="headerlink" title="Followup:"></a>Followup:</h3><p>Student:<br>Wow. What an mind-blowing answer. Steven Bi is THE CS God.</p>
<p>Student:<br>Upper div office hours are certainly smaller than those for lower divs (or<br>more specifically: office hours for smaller courses have fewer people), and<br>the timing of the week matters quite a bit as well. Certainly, the earlier the<br>office hours (with respect to when the assignment is due), the less crowded<br>it’ll be.</p>
<p>For 170, my office hours were generally earlier in the week (i.e. I don’t like<br>holding office hours right on the day the homework is due, so I usually<br>don’t), and I can’t recall a single occasion when I felt that I didn’t have<br>enough time to respond to all of the students (barring the OH right before the<br>exam).</p>
<p>170 is also not a coding-based class, and so I didn’t have to spend time<br>trying to read/debug students’ code. I think OH for that class is generally<br>unlikely to be too rushed.</p>
<p>I’ve had students who only appear once or twice, and I’ve had regulars who<br>just met with their study groups at my office hours. I think that the<br>difference is more based on your personal preference.</p>
<p>Piazza can handle some (many) questions, but if the question is more involved<br>(as some conceptual questions tend to be), I’ll fairly strongly advocate<br>asking in office hours. As an instructor, being able to gauge the student’s<br>understanding in real time and working on a whiteboard for visualizing are<br>immensely useful in explaining concepts. (There have definitely been questions<br>on Piazza that I’ve ignored because they’re too tedious to explain there, but<br>which would have been straightforward to answer in person. Also, some students<br>aren’t very good at asking questions and it’s hard to figure out what the<br>source of their confusion is via Piazza.)</p>
<p>Student:<br>Try going to office hours when there is no homework/projects due. It’s pretty<br>fun to pick at the TAs brains.</p>
<p>Student:<br>Office hours for CS classes in my experience tend to be rushed and unhelpful<br>because the TA’s have limited time and lots of people to deal with. On Piazza<br>you’ll usually get a thoughtful answer promptly.</p>
<p>Student:<br>I just ask on piazza</p>
<h3 id="Followup-153"><a href="#Followup-153" class="headerlink" title="Followup:"></a>Followup:</h3><p>Student:<br>I’m rarely worried about not finishing an exam, so I never timed myself. If I<br>was concerned about this, I would probably time only the last exam or two, at<br>the very end of my preparation, to get a sense of pacing.</p>
<p>Whether or not I do it by-question is depending if I’m still in the learning-<br>phase of studying (esp. in courses when I haven’t really been following the<br>course/doing the homework properly, and I’m using exams to figure out what I<br>was supposed to have learned) or if I’m actually testing myself.</p>
<p>If it’s the former, I’ll usually read individual questions, think for a bit,<br>and then go straight to reading the solution, since I presumably can’t solve<br>the problems.</p>
<p>If it’s the latter, I’ll write out semi-full solutions to all of the problems<br>before checking my answers.</p>
<p>Student:<br>As a freshman who got an A in 61A and an A+ in 70, I’ll chime in here - I do<br>them untimed because I find that removing the pressure from the clock really<br>helps. Keep in mind that there’s often a common thread to test questions<br>because there’s only so many things that they can test, so once you find that<br>common thread, tests become that much easier. As for the answer key, I like<br>having immediate feedback, especially since one question doesn’t really help<br>or hinder the next, but I can see how individual preferences might vary.  </p>
<p>Best of luck!</p>

With that said, even if that<br>requirement is removed I am considering doing a Minor in Mathematics, which<br>still does require Math 54. So I’m wondering what I should be doing at this<br>point, and if there is any possibility that the Math Department would take<br>EE16A/B as substitutes as well (long shot, I know…)</p>
<h3 id="Instructor-answer-26"><a href="#Instructor-answer-26" class="headerlink" title="Instructor answer"></a>Instructor answer</h3><p>The answer remains the same as a year ago (please find those posts). This<br>requirement has not been removed and all students are encouraged to complete<br>it.</p>
<p>The only change is that students who have completed EE16A &amp; 16B may now<br>complete Math 110 instead of Math 54. (EECS only)</p>
<h3 id="Followup-156"><a href="#Followup-156" class="headerlink" title="Followup:"></a>Followup:</h3><p>Elad Alon:<br>For EECS majors, you can indeed take Math 110 instead Math 54 (since you will<br>have taken both EE16A and EE16B).</p>
<p>For L&amp;S majors, if you take EE16B, you can use that to fulfill the requirement<br>for Math 54 (i.e., you can use 16B to replace Math 54).</p>
<p>Student:<br>From @1350:</p>
<p>“To give some more general advice/summarize, if you feel like you have gotten<br>a good grasp on linear algebra from 16A/B, there shouldn’t be any need for you<br>to take Math 54.”</p>
<p>Does this mean that Math 54 isn’t required for EECS majors if we have taken<br>both EE16A and 16B?</p>

If so, will both EE 16A and 16B be<br>requirements for L&amp;S CS majors? I am going to be a freshman next year,<br>intending to declare CS; should I plan to enroll in 16A for fall and 16B for<br>spring in my first year?

<p>We are in the process of getting approval to have the combination of<br>EE16A+EE16B serve as an option to fulfill the math 54 requirement for LS CS<br>students. So, I believe it is indeed likely that you will <em>not</em> need math 54<br>(assuming you have taken 16A and B) by the time you graduate.</p>
<p>My personal recommendation (not necessarily speaking on behalf of the<br>department or anyone else) would indeed be to try and sign up for 16A this<br>fall (and probably 16B in the spring, although you can of course make that<br>decision when the time comes).</p>

<p>Elad Alon:<br>The details of the degree requirements for CoE EECS are slightly different<br>than for L&amp;S CS, but the advice of signing up for EE16A in the fall (assuming<br>you have the appropriate math background from high school) and EE16B in the<br>spring holds for everyone.</p>

It is<br>true that there is less absolute time spent in 16A/B purely on circuits, but<br>to put it in the words of one of my GSIs, what is mostly given up (at least in<br>lecture) relative to 40 are some of the “tricks”. If anyone is interested, I<br>would be happy to walk through more of the details/nuances in terms of the<br>differences, but we committed from very early on in the course design to cover<br>the topics we did include in EE16 deeply and rigorously, and circuits is no<br>exception.</p>

<p>I am planning on taking EE 16B and CS 61C next semester.</p>
<p>I want to take EE 105 for my last 4 units, but I since I’ll be taking it<br>concurrently, I’m not sure how much of a disadvantage I’d be in? I have a<br>friend who said 16A is enough for EE 105, but I’m not sure how true that<br>statement is…</p>
<p>If I’d be at a disadvantage, I’ll just fulfill one of the HSS requirements.</p>

<p>From speaking with students from the 16AB pilot (who are the only ones at this<br>point who could have taken the 16 sequence and now be in 105), my<br>understanding is that they felt well prepared for the content itself, but<br>experienced some difficulties with the (newly added to 105) SPICE labs. (I<br>don’t know if this sentiment was shared by those who had taken 40, so this may<br>not be a differentiator between 16/40). All of that said, as mentioned above,<br>105 is being redesigned to build on the style and specifics of 16A/B, so in<br>the long term 16B is (by design) what you will need to succeed.</p>

<p>147, on the other hand, focuses more on micromechanical (MEMS) devices, such<br>as used in today’s accelerometers, gyroscopes, and timing devices, found in<br>smart phones, cars, etc. It not only covers wafer-level fabrication methods<br>for MEMS that can be quite different from those used for transistors, but also<br>covers methods for designing MEMS devices and appications. You’ll learn to<br>work with masses, springs, forces, and velocities, instead of inductors,<br>capacitors, voltage, and currents.</p>

<p>Student:<br>I’ve taken both; they are very much different. 147 covers maybe 3-4 weeks of<br>fabrication (though it does a great job of it)- and only those pertinent to<br>MEMS. The rest of the class is very much into how MEMS structures work etc.<br>143 is almost completely about the fabrication process, specifically about the<br>intricacies &amp; annoying non-idealities that pop up during the process. In the<br>lab you build some devices (none of which work), and you have to write a lab<br>report about how they work (take 130 concurrently to make this easy), but very<br>little of the actual design/working of devices is covered. I personally<br>preferred 147, (also Pister is great), but if you want to be a process<br>engineer take 143.</p>

I’ve heard that<br>it may be phased out if you took 16A/B, but will that apply retroactively? I’m<br>a current freshman, graduating 2019.</p>
<h3 id="Elad-Alon’s-answer-15"><a href="#Elad-Alon’s-answer-15" class="headerlink" title="Elad Alon’s answer"></a>Elad Alon’s answer</h3><p>The short answer is that we are in the process of getting approvals to make<br>this happen, and I do believe it will be in place by the time you graduate. To<br>give a bit more detail, for the EECS degree requirements, we are currently<br>working on getting approval to have Math 110 serve as a substitute for Math</p>
<ol>
<li>Longer term, we are considering expanding flexibility further to make it<br>so that if you have taken EE16A/B, you can take any upper div. math course, or<br>“math equivalent” upper-div. courses like EE126, EE127, or CS174. (This latter<br>idea is still very early however, so please don’t count on it just yet.)</li>
</ol>
<p>To give some more general advice/summarize, if you feel like you have gotten a<br>good grasp on linear algebra from 16A/B, there shouldn’t be any need for you<br>to take Math 54.</p>
<h3 id="Followup-161"><a href="#Followup-161" class="headerlink" title="Followup:"></a>Followup:</h3><p>Elad Alon:<br>For L&amp;S CS, we are in the process of getting approval to have 16A + 16B<br>replace the need for Math 54. So, assuming you’re planning to take 16B after<br>16A, there probably isn’t a need for you to sign up for 54.</p>

As your colleague indicated, 151<br>has a very substantial lab and more importantly final project component. 140<br>also has a lab and project, and although they may not be quite as time<br>consuming as 151, it definitely isn’t a light load either. I’m not familiar<br>with the load for 176, but 126 most likely wouldn’t be as bad as the previous<br>two in terms of sustained workload, however it can be a conceptually very<br>challenging course, and so you’d to make sure you have enough time to<br>assimilate that material as well.</p>
<p>Long story short - while I don’t think this is absolutely impossible, this<br>does sound like a pretty crazy schedule.

I have also heard about<br>some people who have Ph.D’s in EE who are having difficulty finding jobs.. It<br>doesn’t seem like Berkeley emphasizes EE (as opposed to CS) too much (Though<br>this perception is probably due to my own ignorance)…</p>
<p>How hard is it to get internships in EE? GPA minimum requirements?</p>
<p>EDIT:</p>
<p>First of all, thank you for all the responses. It is very encouraging to know<br>that so many people are willing to answer my questions.</p>
<p>A clarification to the line “I absolutely abhor coding”: This might be a bit<br>of an overstatement. I just am not particularly adept at some of these CS 61B<br>esque style questions, which has in turn caused me to dislike it. I’m not sure<br>if EE is concerned with finding the max distance between 2 nodes in a Binary<br>Search Tree (?). I am perfectly fine with coding that for example, is<br>presented in E7 (i.e. practical applications). I actually enjoy writing the<br>code for the iPython notebooks we have to do in EE 16A. I am perfectly fine<br>with using something like MatLab for mathematical modeling.</p>
<p>Furthermore, my original post heavily implies that I only want to do EE<br>because I don’t want to do CS. I have many interests in EE that I want to<br>explore (i.e. fiber optics, solid state), and overall prefer the designing and<br>integration of multiple concepts that EE requires. I believe that if I had<br>been exposed to EE before taking a CS class, I would have still wanted to do<br>it. I think having to come up with a design for a circuit given a specified<br>problem (and actually getting it right) is extremely satisfying.</p>
<h3 id="Instructor-answer-28"><a href="#Instructor-answer-28" class="headerlink" title="Instructor answer"></a>Instructor answer</h3><p>Here are some responses from our EE faculty:</p>
<p>Randstat has a nice analysis of the perks of EE jobs; EE was one of their “hot<br>jobs” for 2015.  </p>
<p>The numbers are here: <a href="https://www.randstadusa.com/workforce360/jobs-the-
economy/engineering-jobs-in-demand-for-2015/255/" target="_blank" rel="external">https://www.randstadusa.com/workforce360/jobs-the-
economy/engineering-jobs-in-demand-for-2015/255/</a>  </p>
<p>Salient points:<br>- geographic supply and demand imbalance: too many EE’s in some places and<br>too few in others<br>- &gt;10 jobs for every EE graduate<br>- there appear to be &gt;20,000 job openings across the country for EE’s at any<br>given time (I added up the demand circle in the report)</p>
<p>- The national average starting pay for an electrical engineer with three to<br>10 years’ experience is $90,295. (This figure is national- Berkeley’s grads<br>tend to make more)</p>
<p>- EE’s have among the highest salary increases year-to-year. An Electronics<br>Engineer had the highest annual increase at &gt;8%<br>- these jobs are hard to fill so a Berkeley EE is a goose that lays golden<br>eggs<br>- Our Ph.d.’s have no trouble finding very high paying jobs. There are always<br>more internships than students available at Berkeley.  </p>
<h3 id="Followup-163"><a href="#Followup-163" class="headerlink" title="Followup:"></a>Followup:</h3><p>Student:<br>lel I am a filthy CS major</p>
<p>Student:<br>I agree with the above anon. Even as a hardcore EE major, I have to give<br>sufficient credit to my CS peers because they are just different<br>specializations. I can do things that amaze my CS peers and sometimes I’m<br>amazed by what they can do. Instead of looking for differences, how about some<br>synergy? After all, we are in EECS.</p>
<p>Student:<br>There are many software engineers who take EE classes (like my CS friend who<br>took classes like EECS 150) and there are many EE who take CS classes. There<br>are EE who do not take CS classes beyond CS61C and there are many CS people<br>who do not take any EE beyond 16a (or b). The point is that it depends on what<br>the person is interested in.</p>
<p>Silly presumptuous statements such as the ones above are ridiculous supposed<br>ego stoking. Is it really necessary to look down on software engineering just<br>because they don’t want to do EE? Please study what you want and what is<br>interesting to you! But don’t look down on other disciplines just because you<br>didn’t specialise in CSE or CS vs EE vs CE … etc.</p>
<p>smh</p>
<p>Student:<br>Someone who finished a 3 month coding bootcamp can be a software engineer. You<br>don’t need to spend 4 years at Berkeley to be one.</p>
<p>Student:<br>Take the average software engineer. Ask them to build a low-pass filter and do<br>the correct digital signal processing to complete the control loop on a<br>microprocessor.</p>
<p>Take an EE. Ask them to write a website/backend. They will for sure be able to<br>figure it out.</p>
<p>Student:<br>I think that this is extremely presumptive. There is nothing stopping CS and<br>CSE from taking EE classes and many do so.</p>

<h3 id="Elad-Alon’s-answer-19"><a href="#Elad-Alon’s-answer-19" class="headerlink" title="Elad Alon’s answer"></a>Elad Alon’s answer</h3><p>The short answer is that you will be totally fine in EE105/EE120 having taken<br>EE16A/B. Both 105 and 120 have been/are being adjusted to match the<br>coverage/style of 16A/B; 20 and 40 are dead, so it’s in no one’s interest to<br>have the follow-on courses match to them instead of to 16A/B.</p>

<p>During Phase 1, I’d signed up (onto the waitlist) for EE16A, as well as<br>waitlisting for a lab and discussion section respectively. I was recently<br>checking Telebears, and for some reason, the lab that I’d signed up for (EE16A<br>022 LAB) was no longer on there. Was this lab section cancelled? If so, what<br>are the recommended steps to take to ensure that I can actually be waitlisted<br>onto a lab section that exists, without losing my spot on the waitlist? I<br>tried changing only my lab section, but it won’t let me select my old<br>discussion section, which makes me worried as to whether I’ll lose my spot on<br>the waitlist because I had to change both sections.</p>
<h3 id="Elad-Alon’s-answer-21"><a href="#Elad-Alon’s-answer-21" class="headerlink" title="Elad Alon’s answer"></a>Elad Alon’s answer</h3><p>A number of lab sessions had to be cancelled and replaced by new lab sessions<br>in order to facilitate consolidation of all of the labs in to a single room<br>(hence helping to make sure that the labs run smoothly). Everyone who was<br>already enrolled in those sessions should have received an email with<br>instructions, but let me briefly detail here how those of you who are on the<br>waiting list should proceed.</p>
<p>During Telebears Open Hours, please enroll yourself in a new lab and<br>discussion section that has plenty of open seats. Note that the Telebears<br>system unfortunately will force you to change both the lab and the discussion<br>section. However, once the semester starts you can attend whatever discussion<br>section you would like to (labs you will need to attend the section you signed<br>up for), so don’t worry about making having had to switch the discussion in<br>addition to the lab.</p>
<p>(For those of you who are already enrolled and are facing the same problem<br>with needing to switch both lab and discussion, you can rely on the same<br>approach above.)</p>
<h3 id="Followup-164"><a href="#Followup-164" class="headerlink" title="Followup:"></a>Followup:</h3><p>Elad Alon:<br>This change should not directly affect your chance of getting in to the<br>course. Specifically, if you switch to an open lab section using the “switch<br>secondary sections” function in Telebears (e.g., during Open Hours), it will<br>have no affect on your position on the waitlist.</p>
<p>It is very important however that whatever secondary sections (lab or<br>discussion) you sign up for have open seats. If those sections do not have<br>open seats, you will not be enrolled and will be skipped over when the<br>waitlist is processed automatically. So, I would definitely recommend that you<br>sign up for sections that have a large number of open seats, since if there<br>are only 1 or 2 open you may end up not getting in.</p>
<p>We completely understand your concern about having used Phase 1 units, and we<br>are doing everything we can to minimize the impact of the changes we had to<br>make. As explained above, as long as you switch to secondary sections that<br>have plenty of open seats, this shouldn’t impact your priority on the<br>waitlist.</p>
<h3 id="Followup-165"><a href="#Followup-165" class="headerlink" title="Followup:"></a>Followup:</h3><p>Elad Alon:<br>Sure thing. Please see my response to the follow-up immediately above this<br>one; my understanding is that as long as the secondary sections you signed up<br>for have open seats, you will be accepted in the order of the waitlist for the<br>main class.</p>
<h2 id="EE-16B-discussion-sections"><a href="#EE-16B-discussion-sections" class="headerlink" title="EE 16B discussion sections"></a>EE 16B discussion sections</h2><p>2015-11-25<br>I’m currently enrolled in a discussion section that I cannot attend, because<br>the only one that works with my schedule is already full (crazy schedule).</p>
<p>Professors Sahai and Maharbiz, do you know yet what your discussion attendance<br>policy is going to be? Is there a possibility that I could arrange to attend<br>the discussion section that I can actually attend?</p>
<p>On a related note, I wanted to put myself on the waitlist, but TeleBears<br>actually won’t let me because I’m already enrolled. If I drop the course, will<br>TeleBears keep me from adding it again (i.e. can I drop the course and then<br>stick myself on its waitlist)?</p>

If your schedule is crazy, you will<br>have problems beyond this issue. Crazy schedules are not generally a good<br>idea.</p>

<p>I am a new Freshman to Berkeley and got in as Pre-CS.</p>
<p>So here is my dilemma I recently heard a professor (Prof. Sahai) and many<br>students suggest that EECS is better than LSCS in terms of employers/graduate<br>school. However I am really interested in pursuing a double major in Pure Math<br>and CS/EECS. I also am currently doing very well in Math 54 and CS 61a. Is it<br>worth starting the transfer process to COE for EECS? I think I can get the GPA<br>necessary to transfer but I really would like to study pure math. If it makes<br>a difference I want to do the minimum level of EE possible in either majors. I<br>simply do not like circuits or hardware but am willing to do it if EECS is<br>better.</p>
<p>Should I stay or attempt to switch. A lot of people think LSCS is not a strong<br>major cap or not.</p>
<p>Also just out of curiosity why is LSCS a BA but Environmental Economics and<br>Policy a BS. It makes almost no sense!</p>
<h3 id="Instructor-answer-29"><a href="#Instructor-answer-29" class="headerlink" title="Instructor answer"></a>Instructor answer</h3><p>First of all, congratulations on your admission to UC Berkeley! Both of our<br>programs are excellent. Students in EECS and LSCS take the same classes with<br>the same faculty. As the student above mentioned, if you plan to pursue a<br>double major, LSCS has the same breadth requirements as math, so you will not<br>need to complete extra breadth requirements. In addition, it can be very<br>difficult to transfer into COE. The requirements for transfer can be found<br>here: <a href="http://engineering.berkeley.edu/admissions/undergrad-admissions/change-
college" target="_blank" rel="external">http://engineering.berkeley.edu/admissions/undergrad-admissions/change-

<p>As Professor Sahai states, there are some differences in priority for the two<br>majors. If you have questions about how this will impact you, please don’t<br>hesitate to email me<br>(<a href="mailto:svannostrand@eecs.berkeley.edu" target="_blank" rel="external">svannostrand@eecs.berkeley.edu</a>). As<br>Professor Sahai and others have mentioned, it’s important to do what is right<br>for you and for your education. For folks in industry and graduate schools, it<br>doesn’t matter whether you pursue EECS or LSCS.</p>

<h3 id="Elad-Alon’s-answer-22"><a href="#Elad-Alon’s-answer-22" class="headerlink" title="Elad Alon’s answer"></a>Elad Alon’s answer</h3><p>There certainly isn’t a “right” answer to this one, but if I had to choose one<br>of the two, I would probably recommend taking 16B first. The main reasons for<br>this are that (1) 16B is a somewhat broader intro course, so it would open<br>more doors for you (61C opens doors to classes as well, but less broadly so),<br>and (2) 16B covers at a somewhat more basic level some material that also<br>shows up in 61C. (There are no changes in 61C planned/expected because of<br>this, but over the long term, we expect that people will in all likelihood<br>have taken 16B before or at most concurrently with 61C.)</p>
<p>I’m not sure about a 61C alternate final, but will ping the instructors to<br>ask.</p>

<p>It is in general a very bad idea to take 70 without meeting its official<br>prereq: sophomore mathematical maturity (from the perspective of the EECS<br>department). Getting a 5 on the Calc BC exam is definitely not enough, by<br>itself, to have sophomore mathematical maturity. Taking Math 1A and 1B in some<br>cases (for students who pay attention, actually read the book carefully, pay<br>attention in lecture, and understand the proofs instead of just doing the HW<br>and hunting for formulas) is enough to provide sophomore mathematical<br>maturity, but it sometimes isn’t enough. Some people catch up quickly, quite a<br>few do not. (I have seen more tears in 70 than I care to remember, and this is<br>a big part of what drove us to create 16AB. We want to stop these tears.) Math<br>53&amp;54 have historically been better about getting students ready for 70<br>maturity-wise, but again, can be a bit hit or miss. (Not as much as 1AB, but<br>still.) Meanwhile, some students get here straight from high school with the<br>adequate mathematical maturity.</p>
<p>With the advent of EECS 16AB, they represent the definitive sense of what<br>defines sophomore mathematical maturity. These are what we officially deem to<br>be the Freshman EECS courses alongside 61AB. And 16AB are on the mathematical<br>track, just like 70 is as a sophomore course. 70 is the third course in the<br>mathy sequence, just like 61C is the third course in the software engineering<br>sequence.</p>

<h2 id="Taking-EE16B-or-Not"><a href="#Taking-EE16B-or-Not" class="headerlink" title="Taking EE16B or Not"></a>Taking EE16B or Not</h2><p>2015-10-28<br>Hi, I’m a freshman EECS major with just a few questions.</p>
<p>First, if we are currently enrolled in EE16A, is it required for us to take<br>EE16B in the Spring of 2016? Or, instead can we choose take our other required<br>classes, such as Physics 7a and Math 53 (Plus CS61B and an AC requirement)?<br>And, of course, then proceed to take EE16B in either Fall 2016 or Spring 2017.</p>
<p>However, if that is not required, is it <em>recommended</em> that we take EE16B in<br>Spring 2016? If so, why? I ask this because I feel that although these courses<br>are designed as intro courses, I would much rather go into them with a better<br>understanding and skill level in physics and math. Thus, I am leaning towards<br>taking my math and physics courses prior to taking EE16B.</p>
<p>Also, is there any update as to whether EE16A and EE16B will account for Math<br>54? If not, would it better to take Math 53 or Math 54 before EE16B?</p>
<p>Lastly, during our TeleBears appointment, do we have to choose the courses<br>that we discussed with our faculty advisor? I thought of taking different<br>courses after having spoke with my faculty advisor.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<h3 id="Elad-Alon’s-answer-24"><a href="#Elad-Alon’s-answer-24" class="headerlink" title="Elad Alon’s answer"></a>Elad Alon’s answer</h3><p>Hi There,</p>
<p>It is not required to take 16B in spring if you are currently enrolled in 16A.<br>The recommendation is to finish the series within your first 3 semesters.<br>Faculty may want to chime in about your desire to have more physics and math<br>before taking 16B. (Edit by Elad: please see my note below with<br>comments/suggestions on this and other points.)</p>
<p>At this point there is no update on Math 54; it is still a requirement. Please<br>see post @556 for more information.</p>
<h3 id="Followup-166"><a href="#Followup-166" class="headerlink" title="Followup:"></a>Followup:</h3><p>Elad Alon:<br>Getting your lower div. requirements done by the end of sophomore year is<br>certainly a good idea, but if e.g. one of those courses (particularly one that<br>doesn’t have a specific lead in to material you’re interested in learning more<br>about later) ends up in junior year that isn’t to bad. I’d recommend putting<br>together a “four year plan” and then you’ll be able to tell what the<br>implications of the various choices are.</p>
<p>To be more specific, given the exposure you’ve already had in 16A and that<br>you’d like to get some more background in linear algebra, taking 61B, 16B, and<br>Math 54 should be very manageable (and would certainly keep you on track).</p>
<p>Student:<br>Oh, and 61C also remains.</p>
<p>Student:<br>Your response hit it right on the dot - thank you.</p>
<p>I was told in faculty advising, however, that I should be taking 3 technicals.<br>From what I understand, ideally, by the end of sophomore year, I should have<br>completed my lower div requirements (remaining: 61B, 16B, 53, 54, 7a, 7b,<br>CS70). If I was to only take 2 techs (61B and 16B) next semester, would I<br>still be on track?</p>
<p>Regardless, I would like more practice with linear algebra so I believe taking<br>54 alongside 16B will be quite beneficial.</p>
<p>Elad Alon:<br>It’s probably worth mentioning that taking just two techs (61B and 16B) is<br>perfectly acceptable and you shouldn’t feel the need to do more than that.<br>Also, the way I am interpreting your question (please correct me if I’m wrong)<br>is that you are asking about which of those three classes would have greatest<br>synergy with EE16B in terms of the content?</p>
<p>If my assumption above is correct, out of the three you mentioned,Math 54 is<br>by far the most directly relevant. That said, it’s largely a question of how<br>comfortable you feel with the linear algebra material in 16A. If you feel<br>pretty comfortable with it, then Math 54 will be repetitive and may not be<br>worth it; but if you would like to get some more practice/etc. with that<br>material, then by all means that’s the class I would go for (out of the three<br>you mentioned)</p>
<p>Student:<br>Thank you for those responses. Another question:</p>
<p>If I do take EE16B in the Spring, along with CS61B (and an American Cultures<br>requirement) what other class should I take with these 3 - regarding Physics<br>7a, Math 53, and Math 54? Specifically, which of these classes would be the<br>best to take alongside EE16B and really help me develop my skills?</p>
<p>Thanks again</p>
<p>Anant Sahai:<br>I’m going to second what my colleague Elad Alon has said.</p>
<p>And I want to add that with this particular full-scale cohort of 16A (folks<br>taking it this term), we are going to be gently adjusting and balancing the<br>material across 16A and 16B (and eventually 70). So, this next 16B is going to<br>pick up pretty much exactly where this 16A leaves off. Our goal is to educate<br>you and so we will choose to pace the course so that it works. We are also<br>going to be understanding of the times when there are difficulties that come<br>from “growing pains” in the course — and take that into account while<br>grading. So, you’re best off just following through with the sequence along<br>with your classmates. Future offerings are going to reflect the more fully<br>stabilized material and depend on the stabilized 16A. So, in later 16Bs, you<br>might find yourself missing something that your classmates learned in their<br>16A — that was inserted there in response to what we learned from this<br>particular 16A, and that we chose to patch in 16B instead.</p>
<p>Elad Alon:<br>I should have also noted BTW that if anyone would like to get some personal<br>advice about EE16B and your course schedule, please feel free to contact me or<br>simply swing by my office hours.</p>

<h3 id="Followup-167"><a href="#Followup-167" class="headerlink" title="Followup:"></a>Followup:</h3><p>Student:<br>Hi,</p>
<p>I’m a freshman and my advisor never mentioned any of this to me, she simply<br>told me to register for 54. Now I’m in EE16A this semester, but now I’m<br>worried about the the material that I’m missing out on by skipping 16B. What<br>should I do? Should I take 16B anyways?</p>
<p>Student:<br>Cornell CS also isn’t accredited</p>
<p>Student:<br>It just means that Berkeley doesn’t try to have CS reviewed by another<br>organization… it doesn’t mean anything though… Carnegie Mellon SCS and<br>Stanford CS are not accredited as well but Berkeley EECS and MIT EECS are</p>
<p>Student:<br>What does it mean that L&amp;S CS isn’t accredited?</p>
<p>Anant Sahai:<br>I’m sure I’ll teach 70 at some point in the future, though it might be years<br>from now. Currently, I am focused on getting 16a (this semester) and 16b (next<br>semester) up to be great courses leading up to 70. The 16ab courses are being<br>built with lots of the teaching ideas from 70 used throughout. Although the<br>material can be different, you can think of 16ab as being taught “like 70, but<br>with labs.”</p>
<p>Student:<br>Hi Prof. Sahai,</p>
<p>There has been a lot of speculation, but is it true that you will not teach CS<br>70 anymore? People have said that your CS 70 is one of the best taught CS 70s</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>An Anonymous Student</p>
<p>Anant Sahai:<br>Spring 16a is going to be running at the maximum possible size. There are<br>limits on TA availability. (This will get better as more students run through<br>the new courses and a deeper pool of potential TAs has been trained.)</p>
<p>Our own preference is that Freshmen should take it. However, true seniors who<br>haven’t taken 20 or 40 yet are in a hard place. So, they have to be given<br>preference. But we believe that the L&amp;S backlog will be clearing out over the<br>next semester or two. The EECS backlog will be entirely eliminated after next<br>semester.</p>
<p>I think that there is enough difference in perspective in 54 and 16ab that 16a<br>will be fun even for them. But yeah, taking a freshman course as a senior<br>could very well be boring for some. Oh well. In the long run, we really would<br>like to get both 16ab taken by L&amp;S people before they declare, but we will<br>have to see what the best way is.</p>
<p>Student:<br>What about those of us who are Math/Stats/Econ/etc. double majors in L and S<br>who require Math 54</p>
<p>Student:<br>Looks like LSCS people who have taken 54 are in for a really boring EE 16a</p>
<p>Student:<br>Do you think it will be possible that EE 16a can expand like CS61b? the<br>difference is only 200 students (about 900 in 61b vs 700 in 16a)… currently<br>the LSCS advisors seem to be pushing LSCS students to all take EE 16a their<br>senior year, since the new course enrollment procedures have a very very large<br>amount of seats reserved for LSCS seniors.</p>
<p>Why would the EECS department purposefully try to hamstring half of its<br>students… :(</p>
<p>Wouldn’t the department encouraging EE16a to be taken as sophomores rather<br>than seniors (since LSCS would be declared by the end of freshman year) be a<br>better option? (even adding EE16a to the declaration sequence like CS 61a,b,70<br>since it appears to be a rather important class)</p>
<p>Student:<br>i am wondering about something similar ^</p>
<p>Student:<br>Slightly confused - if I’m a LSCS freshman who plans on taking both 16A/16B,<br>should I hold off on Math 54? Even though it’s currently still a graduation<br>requirement, and it’s not guaranteed that I’ll even get 16A anytime soon?</p>
<p>Anant Sahai:<br>First, 70 is not the same as Math 55. They are very different, even though<br>there is some conceptual overlap.</p>
<p>From our point of view, taking Math 54 and 16a together makes about as much<br>sense as taking Math 55 and 70 together. Yes, the added practice and different<br>approaches from Math 55 would definitely help you in 70. Just because more<br>practice and seeing different approaches helps with anything. But is it the<br>most effective use of your time? Probably not. So take 16a and 16b first. Then<br>decide for yourself if you want to take Math 54.</p>
<p>Are Math 54 and 61a adequate prep for 70? In some cases, yes. In other cases,<br>no. Depends on both the student and who taught them 54. It is in part because<br>of those “no cases” that 16ab exist.</p>
<p>Student:<br>Would it make sense, then, to take EE16A and Math 54 concurrently? (if I<br>intend to take 16B in Fall 2016)</p>
<p>Student:<br>I’ve taken Maths 54 not 55</p>
<p>Student:<br>Isn’t CS 70 == Math 55? if so you should be fine</p>
<p>Student:<br>Thanks for the information!<br>Just to be clear, if a person has taken Maths 54 and CS61A, how prepared is<br>he/she for CS 70?</p>
<p>Student:<br>Thank you! It seems like getting into EE16a will be much easier once LSCS<br>people are able to declare (which for most will be around the end of Freshman<br>year)</p>
<p>Anant Sahai:<br>The goal of the design of 16a AND 16b is to serve both the EECS and L&amp;S CS<br>populations as freshmen, or whenever they would be in principle prepared to<br>take Math 54. (5 on the Calc BC or actually, even having finished Calc 1A at<br>Berkeley itself.)</p>
<p>So, yeah, we would recommend L&amp;S intended-CS to take 16a and then 16b as soon<br>as possible. We designed 16a and 16b to be so that 16a, 16b, and 70 form a<br>sequence like 61a, 61b, and 61c. Both myself and more importantly, Gireeja<br>Ranade who had given guest lectures in 70 and is a prime force behind the 16<br>sequence, saw that many students suffered in 70 because of inadequate courses<br>before that. 16ab solve that.</p>
<p>The problem is that right now, there is so much backlog that we can’t open<br>enough seats for L&amp;S intended CS freshmen. Much to our dismay, but seats are<br>finite. Oh well. The problem will get fixed once the backlog is cleared.</p>
<p>Student:<br>Hi Professor Sahai,</p>
<p>So if we are LSCS do you recommend taking EE16a early (possibly so that we can<br>see the more applied parts of Linear Algebra) ?</p>
<p>I am currently a freshman enrolled in Math 54. However, the class certainly<br>seems more theory focused, with students focusing on concepts like subspaces<br>and vector spaces for very long periods of time.</p>
<p>Anant Sahai:<br>Quite possible in practice, yes… However, you should separate out two<br>questions. As far as graduation requirements go, they are really only<br>important when you are about to graduate. There is also the question of<br>actually needing the material for our courses. So make sure that you take 16AB<br>as soon as you can. That way, you will have the understanding required to<br>tackle EECS upper-div courses that need linear algebra.</p>
<p>Student:<br>Right now I’m planning to take Math 54 spring of my sophomore year. (I’m a<br>freshman right now). Is it possible the requirement might be changed by then?</p>
<p>Anant Sahai:<br>Actually, the possibility extends even more strongly to L&amp;S CS. The idea is<br>that 16a and 16b together will obviate the need for Math 54 prereqs for our<br>own courses. (And moving the requirement would keep the total number of<br>courses required neutral.) And given that L&amp;S CS is not an accredited program,<br>we won’t have the requirement to have two math courses from the Math<br>department. So it is much easier to change the requirements. Having the<br>department’s full lower-div courses being taken by both sets of students, EECS<br>and L&amp;S CS, will help in aligning both groups together both culturally and<br>educationally as far as the upper-divs are concerned. 16AB are being built<br>explicitly with the needs of upper-divs like 184, 189, 170, 127, etc. in mind<br>as well as for 70.</p>
<p>Student:<br>Just EECS (The idea behind this is that ee 16a and 16b wil cover enough math<br>54 material).</p>

Both deal with<br>probability, but in 126, the focus is more on understanding the underlying<br>concepts, the theory, and how they can be used to model situations and apply<br>in different settings. By contrast, in 174, the focus is a little bit more on<br>technical tricks and techniques that can be used to analyze randomized<br>algorithms. Overall, 126 is the more “core” supported course in the<br>department. It’s offered every term, etc.</p>
<p>My personal perspective is that after taking 126 and 170, you should be able<br>to get a lot of the value in 174 by reading the truly excellent textbook for<br>174 and then applying the ideas if you ever need to analyze a randomized<br>algorithm. The reverse is not true. Your conceptual foundation in probability<br>after just 70 isn’t strong enough. After 126, it should definitely be quite<br>strong. With 174 alone, it is possible to still have conceptual/intuition<br>holes if you find yourself just relying on the techniques. Basically, if you<br>have to take just one, take 126. If you have to take one first, take 126<br>first.</p>
<p>Lily Zhang: The only additional information I have for you is that CS 174<br>focuses on randomized algorithms and using probabilistic processes to analyze<br>algorithms learned in CS170. I would also add that I recommend speaking with<br>the instructors to determine which course would fit your interests. Office<br>hours and faculty advising are great places to do this :)</p>

<p>From previous years that Fox/Patterson have taught CS169, I’ve heard there is<br>no final, but there are in class quizzes.

<h3 id="Anant-Sahai’s-answer-115"><a href="#Anant-Sahai’s-answer-115" class="headerlink" title="Anant Sahai’s answer"></a>Anant Sahai’s answer</h3><p>16AB are designed with L&amp;S intended-CS students very much in mind. (As long as<br>you have a 5 on the Calc BC AP exam or equivalent) It’s only because of the<br>backlog of demand that it has been nearly impossible for them to get in till<br>next semester.</p>
<p>We are hoping to have some seats available for L&amp;S intended-CS freshmen in 16A<br>in Spring. The Fall offering was super impacted and we were sadly unable to<br>let more than a handful of intended-CS freshmen into the course — or for<br>that matter, even declared CS students. The Spring offering is both bigger and<br>we expect that most of the pent-up EECS demand will already have been<br>satisfied in Fall. So, quite a few seats should be available for L&amp;S students.</p>
<p>However, our initial estimates say that 16A in the Spring might still be<br>oversubscribed and because of lab-space limits, the size can’t grow<br>significantly beyond what is on the schedule. So if you are L&amp;S intended-CS,<br>be sure to keep that in mind.</p>

<p>Student:<br>Don’t fret. The reason you were kicked off the wait list last spring was<br>likely because it was a very small, limited trial run focused on the classes<br>target demographic (freshmen/sophomores). The reason for that note is that<br>moving forward this EE16A/B is supposed to be for lower division standing<br>students, but the department understands that during the transition from 20/40<br>to 16A/B it won’t quite work out that way.</p>

<p>One clarification however - are the two of you L&amp;S majors, or CoE? If CoE, you<br>would need both EE16A and EE16B to graduate, which wouldn’t be possible in a<br>single semester since one requires the other.</p>

<p>We will teach linear algebra, connect it to practical context, with intuition<br>more deeply rooted than you would get in math 54. Everywhere in EECS that used<br>to depend on math 54 is going to shift to expecting EECS 16ab instead.</p>

<p>If you are taking Math 1B to be safe even though you have a 5 on the Calculus<br>BC exam or equivalent, then you should almost certainly be taking EE16A<br>instead. Most EECS freshmen will be in 61a and 16a together.</p>
<p>If instead you don’t really understand basic calculus, then you should indeed<br>take Math 1B and then take 16A in the Spring alongside 61b. Students in 16a<br>need to feel comfortable with math and calculus. We don’t expect lots of fancy<br>integration tricks, etc. But it is important to feel comfortable with what a<br>derivative is, how to do simple integrals, how to maximize a simple function<br>by taking the derivative, and to be able to follow simple derivations of<br>formulae.</p>

<p>Anant Sahai:<br>It’s up to you. It depends on why you got a 4 on the Calc AB exam and why you<br>took the AB exam instead of the BC exam.</p>
<p>But most likely, the reasons why these two things happened indicate that it is<br>better for you to take math 1b.</p>

<h3 id="Elad-Alon’s-answer-29"><a href="#Elad-Alon’s-answer-29" class="headerlink" title="Elad Alon’s answer"></a>Elad Alon’s answer</h3><p>EE141 and CS150 actually already shared lectures last semester (Spring 2015),<br>and will continue to do so this semester. Both courses cover key concepts in<br>digital circuit and system design - the difference is really only that CS150<br>exercises these concepts (and covers the appropriate tools/flows) by applying<br>them to FPGA based implementations, whereas EE141 focuses on integrated<br>circuit implementations (again learning the appropriate tools/flows).</p>
<p>It depends on the specific requirements of the job, but most likely if you<br>take EE141 you would have the skills needed to do the work of a job that asked<br>for CS150. (There may be some specific tools/flows you would need to pick up,<br>but this should be quite do-able.)</p>
<p>Traditionally, the CS150 lab had a more complex project (since the level of<br>abstraction you needed to specifically engineer was higher than EE141), but<br>I’d recommend getting in touch with the instructors (Vladimir Stojanovic and<br>John Wawrzynek) to find out more about their specific plans for this offering.</p>

Essentially all of whom should be in<br>16a alongside 61a. Once they have enrolled, we will enroll by priority. EECS<br>students who used phase 1 units will get priority to get in. A smattering of<br>others might also make it. The first midterm is before the drop deadline, and<br>with some natural attrition, we expect a significant number of those who stick<br>through to get in.</p>
<p>Next semester and beyond, we expect to have more room for non-eecs students<br>since the eecs backlog will have been reduced by a lot.</p>
<h3 id="Followup-176"><a href="#Followup-176" class="headerlink" title="Followup:"></a>Followup:</h3><p>Student:<br>Thanks!</p>
<p>Anant Sahai:<br>Probably not. But who knows.</p>
<h3 id="Followup-177"><a href="#Followup-177" class="headerlink" title="Followup:"></a>Followup:</h3><p>Anant Sahai:<br>Pragmatically, the chances aren’t that great. Right now, there are 160<br>potential seats available. We expect maybe another 20-60 or so EECS freshmen<br>to sign up. That leaves somewhere between 110-140 seats that can flow to the<br>waitlist.</p>
<p>There are about 90 EECS people on the waitlist. They’ll get priority and it<br>looks like a pretty safe bet for them.</p>
<p>So, this leaves about 20-50 seats for others. Within that, we will probably<br>prioritized undeclared intended-CS freshmen (to help align them into the new<br>system), but there aren’t that many of them signed up. So other people are<br>definitely going to get in from the waitlist. Beyond the waitlist, there will<br>be some natural attrition as people drop the course ahead of the drop deadline<br>for random reasons — probably another 25 seats at least will free up if 5%<br>drop. So, another set of persistent people will be able to get off of the<br>waitlist and into the course. But not everyone.</p>
<p>We’d love to be able to get everyone in, but we don’t have the lab space, hw<br>party space, or teaching resources.</p>
<p>Currently, my advice to folks who have a specifically “EE” requirement that<br>needs to be filled like MechE or BioE or so on is to take EE40 the last time<br>it is offered. That is a traditional EE course of the type that serves MechE<br>students well. They should not really be in the 16A waitlist. 16A is not<br>currently designed to, by itself, serve the needs of those students. It is<br>designed to be an introductory EECS course that will, together with 16B, serve<br>the needs of EECS and L&amp;S CS students primarily. These folks should drop off<br>the waitlist for sure and register for 40.</p>
<p>For experienced L&amp;S CS students who are already taking upper-division EECS<br>courses and really just want to take one course and graduate — if you are<br>viewing 16A as a breadth course, you’re probably better off just taking 20 or<br>40 since it is the last time those are being offered. 16A isn’t intended to be<br>approached as a breadth course for anyone. If you just want to be able to take<br>105 or 130 or 140 or 142, taking 40 is probably the better option. 16AB are<br>going to be run and taught and graded assuming that the core set of students<br>are freshmen — the way that 61AB are. 40 and 20 are more sophomore-aimed<br>courses, the way 61C and 70 are.</p>
<h2 id="Physics-7B"><a href="#Physics-7B" class="headerlink" title="Physics 7B"></a>Physics 7B</h2><p>2015-07-27<br>Does Physics 7B content overlap with the content learned in EE16A? I was<br>considering taking Physics 7B as a freshman but wasn’t sure if I would need to<br>take a Math 5X course beforehand.</p>
<h3 id="Elad-Alon’s-answer-30"><a href="#Elad-Alon’s-answer-30" class="headerlink" title="Elad Alon’s answer"></a>Elad Alon’s answer</h3><p>I believe there is a small amount of overlap between Physics 7B and EE16A in<br>terms of circuits-related content. The focus in Physics 7B is (understandably)<br>the underlying physics of the components and a little bit about how they work<br>in circuits, whereas in EE16A we will be focusing more on circuits themselves<br>as a vehicle to expose you to the design process and how to apply it to solve<br>problems. Note that you don’t need any prior knowledge/exposure to circuits<br>for EE16A - we will be introducing the basics of circuits on an as-needed<br>basis in the class.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that Physics 7B does use multivariable calculus (mostly for<br>the E&amp;M portion of the class), so you probably want to have Math 53 under your<br>belt before taking it.</p>

<p>2015-07-27<br>Hello, I received the notice that anyone who got a 5 or higher on the Calculus<br>BC test should be taking EE16A over something like Math 53 or Math 54. I’m<br>happy to switch into that if its recommended, but when looking at schedule<br>builder and the online schedule of classes, it didn’t seem like there were<br>available seats, or in those classes with available seats, the waitlist was<br>the same size. I’m worried that if I swap into the class in favor of Math 53,<br>I might not get into the class. (I did notice in the email that was sent out<br>that you were saving spots for incoming students in a situation like mine, but<br>would like a second confirmation!)</p>
<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated!!!</p>

The Math 54 class and section 1 of Math<br>53 class are both full. I could take Physics 7B instead of EE16A, but from all<br>the discussion about taking EE16A, I think I would rather take EE16A first<br>semester. So is there anything else I can do to avoid 2 finals on the same<br>day?</p>
<h3 id="Elad-Alon’s-answer-32"><a href="#Elad-Alon’s-answer-32" class="headerlink" title="Elad Alon’s answer"></a>Elad Alon’s answer</h3><p>I’ll let Anant comment on final scheduling options for EE16A, but assuming you<br>were planning to take three technical courses and that the Physics 7B final<br>isn’t the same day, taking CS61A, EE16A, and Physics 7B is a perfectly<br>reasonable option. Or, you could take just CS61A and EE6A and fill in the rest<br>of your schedule with non-technical courses; the vast majority of upper-div.<br>EECS courses are gated by the CS61/EE16 series (not by math/physics), so if<br>you choose this option you’d still be in great shape in terms of getting<br>yourself ready for the rest of the program.</p>

<h3 id="Elad-Alon’s-answer-33"><a href="#Elad-Alon’s-answer-33" class="headerlink" title="Elad Alon’s answer"></a>Elad Alon’s answer</h3><p>You should be able to switch sections without going through the waitlist. That<br>said, if from whatever reason you run in to trouble with this, don’t worry too<br>much about “officially” changing your section - once the semester starts you<br>can attend any section you’d like to as long as there is room. (The people who<br>signed up for that section have priority, but this a form of politeness and in<br>practice is rarely important.) Please do be sure to sign up for and stick to<br>the appropriate lab however since the labs are substantially more space and<br>resource constrained.</p>

I’ve check to make sure that the discussion I’m switching to isn’t full,<br>but the problem persists. Any ideas on how to solve this?</p>
<h3 id="Anant-Sahai’s-answer-122"><a href="#Anant-Sahai’s-answer-122" class="headerlink" title="Anant Sahai’s answer"></a>Anant Sahai’s answer</h3><p>Don’t worry so much about discussion sections — we will let people attend<br>other sections as long as there is room. (Priority is for people registered in<br>that section but that is just simple politeness.) The lab section is what<br>matters since labs are required and more tightly space-constrained.</p>
<h2 id="General-EECS-Requirements"><a href="#General-EECS-Requirements" class="headerlink" title="General EECS Requirements"></a>General EECS Requirements</h2><p>2015-07-27<br>Is Math 1B required to be taken for a letter grade for EECS majors even if<br>you’ve gotten a 5 on the AP Calculus BC exam?

<h3 id="Anant-Sahai’s-answer-123"><a href="#Anant-Sahai’s-answer-123" class="headerlink" title="Anant Sahai’s answer"></a>Anant Sahai’s answer</h3><p>A 5 on the Calc BC gets you out of both Math 1A and 1B.</p>
<p>EE16A is designed to be taken concurrently with CS61A. (Taking CS61A before is<br>also alright for people who got here before EE16A was available or for those<br>who did not get a 5 on the Calc BC or equivalent.)</p>
<p>We recommend taking EE16A before Math 5X, but it is up to you. You can take<br>them concurrently.</p>

<p>Sahai said that it would be sometime during the end of phase 1 and its<br>currently phase 2 right now and nothing has happened.</p>
<h3 id="Instructor-answer-37"><a href="#Instructor-answer-37" class="headerlink" title="Instructor answer"></a>Instructor answer</h3><p>We are currently talking with Professor Sahai about when to process the wait<br>list. Per his request, it will happen sometime in the next couple of weeks.</p>
<h3 id="Followup-178"><a href="#Followup-178" class="headerlink" title="Followup:"></a>Followup:</h3><p>Student:<br>Thank you for such quick response! Is there an estimate as to much time should<br>we expect before admission?</p>
<p>Anant Sahai:<br>Yes, this is still the case. We expect to be able to let in all rising<br>sophomore EECS students who used phase I units on 16a.</p>
<p>Student:<br>Is this still the case? I just enrolled in my phase II classes but my schedule<br>will change a lot if I do not get into EE16A this semester. I am unfortunately<br>no longer able to enroll in any of my other 5 lower division technical classes<br>I have to take this year because I used my phase I units on EE as advised. I<br>am a rising sophomore EECS student planning to declare ECE. Is there any<br>update on the likelihood of admission to this class?</p>
<p>Anant Sahai:<br>The problem appears to be partially technical. Our forecasts are that there<br>will be room for essentially all waitlisted EECS students who spent Phase 1<br>slots on EE16A. However, there is no way in telebears to reserve seats for the<br>freshmen in secondary sections (labs and discussions) and so, we can’t just<br>add all the EECS students to the course now. We are concerned that too many of<br>the secondary sections will fill up and the freshmen won’t be able to fit 16A<br>into their schedules (they also don’t realize that in EECS, people can usually<br>attend other discussion sections, etc….).</p>
<p>We understand that this is annoying, but there appears to be no better<br>solution.</p>
<p>Student:<br>Per instruction from the EE 16A faculty team, we are waiting for some<br>additional freshmen and transfer students to add. We hope to have more<br>information soon about when the wait list will be processed.</p>

<h3 id="Anant-Sahai’s-answer-124"><a href="#Anant-Sahai’s-answer-124" class="headerlink" title="Anant Sahai’s answer"></a>Anant Sahai’s answer</h3><p>In the long-run, the hiring pipeline for 16ab will be like the hiring pipeline<br>for 61ab. But right now at this transition point, it is definitely possible to<br>become a reader and/or academic intern (what was formerly called lab<br>assistant) for 16ab without having taken the course.</p>
<p>As a member of course staff, you’d be expected to stay very current with<br>lecture though. So attending in person and/or watching the webcasts carefully.<br>The material is not some remix of 20 and 40. There is some overlap, but these<br>are entirely new courses.</p>

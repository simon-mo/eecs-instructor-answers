They should not really be in the 16A waitlist. 16A is not currently designed to, by itself, serve the needs of those students. It is designed to be an introductory EECS course that will, together with 16B, serve the needs of EECS and L&amp;S CS students primarily. \u00a0These folks should drop off the waitlist for sure and register for 40.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>For experienced L&amp;S CS students who are already taking upper-division EECS courses and really just want to take one course and graduate --- if you are viewing 16A as a breadth course, you&#39;re probably better off just taking 20 or 40 since it is the last time those are being offered. 16A isn&#39;t intended to be approached as a breadth course for anyone. If you just want to be able to take 105 or 130 or 140 or 142, taking 40 is probably the better option. \u00a016AB are going to be run and taught and graded assuming that the core set of students\u00a0are freshmen --- the way that 61AB are. 40 and 20 are more sophomore-aimed courses, the way 61C and 70 are.</p>\n<p></p>", "created": "2015-07-31T19:11:13Z", "bucket_order": 86, "bucket_name": "Week 7/26 - 8/1", "type": "feedback", "uid": "gxj8rtteeuaa9", "children": [], "id": "ics0a9d6nle1kw", "updated": "2015-07-31T19:11:13Z", "config": {}}], "no_answer": 0, "id": "icryu59763q6ue", "updated": "2015-07-31T18:30:41Z", "config": {}}], "tag_good_arr": [], "no_answer": 0, "id": "icngfq8r73d59s", "config": {}, "status": "active", "upvote_ids": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "bookmarked": 6, "num_favorites": 0, "my_favorite": false, "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "q_edits": [], "i_edits": [], "s_edits": [], "t": 1509625975961, "default_anonymity": "no"}

The reverse is not true. Your conceptual foundation in probability after just 70 isn&#39;t strong enough. After 126, it should definitely be quite strong. With 174 alone, it is possible to still have conceptual/intuition holes if you find yourself just relying on the techniques. Basically, if you have to take just one, take 126.

Or, instead can we choose take our other required classes, such as Physics 7a and Math 53 (Plus CS61B and an AC requirement)? And, of course, then proceed to take EE16B in either Fall 2016 or Spring 2017.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>However, if that is not required, is it <em>recommended</em> that we take EE16B in Spring 2016? If so, why? I ask this because I feel that although these courses are designed as intro courses, I would much rather go into them with a better understanding and skill level in physics and math. Thus, I am leaning towards taking my math and physics courses prior to taking EE16B.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Also, is there any update as to whether EE16A and EE16B will account for Math 54? If not, would it better to take Math 53 or Math 54 before EE16B?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Lastly, during our TeleBears appointment, do we have to choose the courses that we discussed with our faculty advisor?

Getting a 5 on the Calc BC exam is definitely not enough, by itself, to have sophomore mathematical maturity. Taking Math 1A and 1B in some cases (for students who pay attention, actually read the book carefully, pay attention in lecture, and understand the proofs instead of just doing the HW and hunting for formulas) is enough to provide sophomore mathematical maturity, but it sometimes isn&#39;t enough. Some people catch up quickly, quite a few\u00a0do not. (I have seen more tears in 70 than I care to remember, and this is a big part of what drove us to create 16AB. We want to stop these tears.) Math 53&amp;54 have historically been better about getting students ready for 70 maturity-wise, but again, can be\u00a0a bit hit or miss. (Not as much as 1AB, but still.) Meanwhile, some students get here straight from high school with the adequate mathematical maturity.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>With the advent of EECS 16AB, they represent the definitive sense of what defines sophomore mathematical maturity. These are what we officially deem to be the Freshman EECS courses alongside 61AB. And 16AB are on the mathematical track, just like 70 is as a sophomore course. 70 is the third course in the mathy sequence, just like 61C is the third course in the software engineering sequence.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>"}], "type": "i_answer", "tag_endorse_arr": ["hzd1lb5fiuc2sq"], "config": {}, "is_tag_endorse": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["icguxv6pa7o1hg", "hz5sguer69yg4"], "no_answer": 0, "id": "igiq6ztu59i63f", "config": {}, "status": "active", "upvote_ids": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "bookmarked": 8, "num_favorites": 0, "my_favorite": false, "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "q_edits": [], "i_edits": [], "s_edits": [], "t": 1509625988350, "default_anonymity": "no"}

I have many interests in EE that I want to explore (i.e. fiber optics, solid state), and overall prefer the designing and integration of multiple concepts that EE requires. I believe that if I had been exposed to EE before taking a CS class, I would have still wanted to do it. I think having to come up with a design for a circuit given a specified problem (and actually getting it right) is extremely satisfying.</p>"}, {"anon": "full", "subject": "Specializing in EE and jobs..", "created": "2016-03-16T17:35:39Z", "content": "<p>Ok, this is probably going to seem like a very stupid question, but what are the job prospects if you specialize in EE?

I transferred to EECS because of better job prospect (one of many reasons) but I had a hard time deciding which side to do. At the beginning, I also abhorred coding simply because I didn&#39;t have as much experience as other students but in retrospect, those differences in experience can be made up easily. Now getting to your question, I want to emphasize that EE is a labor of love. You cannot do it if you don&#39;t love it. You cannot do it if you simply choose it because you don&#39;t like coding. (EE involves a lot of coding too!) In terms of marketable skills, you will not easily acquire them from just taking classes. In order to be employable, you need longer years of learning and training and switching specialization even within the field can be hard. So from my perspective, do EE if you absolutely like it and you value your love for hardware more than immediate monetary return. Also be ready for graduate school. (If you hate school and just want to starting working already, then EE may not be your top pick) I understand what you are feeling since I have been on this path before.

In particular, to the line\u00a0&#34;absolutely abhor coding.&#34; If anyone thinks that &#34;EE&#34; jobs don&#39;t involve being proficient in writing computer code, they are mistaken. There are a couple of aspects of EECS where you really don&#39;t have a choice --- (a) you must be proficient at writing computer code and thinking in a logical fashion; and (b) you must be able to handle mathematical modeling and thinking. \u00a0Now, in practice in industry, there are definitely paths where someone might not have to do (b). But honestly, the only paths that I know where someone might be able to avoid writing computer code require getting a PhD (or MBA) and then having people working for you who write the computer code. But then, you probably will have to write some computer code while doing your PhD (or while getting the work experience for the MBA) so there is really no escape.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>And culturally as an engineer, you should not *want* to escape something like this.\u00a0Consequently,\u00a0if you say you don&#39;t like coding\u00a0and you&#39;re a freshman, then it probably just means that you need to get better at it. Once you get good at it, then it may very well be that you don&#39;t get a big thrill out of writing code. That&#39;s fine.\u00a0Be sure you choose paths that have aspects that you do find deeply rewarding. (Life is too short to spend working on\u00a0stuff that doesn&#39;t engage you as a person.)

Just replace the non-EECS courses appropriately to reflect L&amp;S college breadth requirements.

There are two 3-course sequences: 61A, 61B, 61C and 16A, 16B, 70. Each of these sequences ramps up difficulty and nurtures\u00a0students so that they are ready for the next course. \u00a0At the last step, the two trilogies interweave somewhat with 61B being gently helpful for 70 as compared to 16B which is directly helpful in terms of core skills.

The deeper\u00a0logic behind the upper-division is not represented here because at that point, there are many choices and tracks based on your interests across the modeling/math/algorithms, software development, and hardware development pathways.

So, I think that about 12ish hours per week on average is what you should expect to be putting in.\u00a0It really depends a lot on the projects, but this isn&#39;t a do-it-all-in-three-nights kind of project.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>For example, one kind of project that I want for sure to have at least one team on (with HCI background) is to develop a human-playable networked game so that we can see how humans\u00a0can learn how to collaborate/coordinate with strangers playing alongside them. If a team was to make a simple framework to make such games, make a game within that framework that exhibited the kinds of phenomena that we&#39;ll see in the DARPA challenge, had people play that game using say Mechanical Turk or some other platform by which we could have multiple people play the game to collect some data, and then analyzed that data to say something about collaborative intelligence --- this would be a solid A project. If the framework was made in a way that also let us drop in some AIs to see how they play against people, this would be a solid A&#43;. \u00a0This work could then turn into a paper and further research down the line if the students want to.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Another kind of project that is still fine for the course would be a replication plus plus type study --- where a group replicates a result like the recent Google paper on learning encryption and then augmented it to see if a similar neural\u00a0network can learn to modulate and error-correct alongside. So lots of flexibility here.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Over the course of a semester, this kind of thing I think is very reasonable to do with a team of 3 students working together.

Whole thing at once, or question by question with answer key?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>From Prof. Sahai:</p>\n<p>1) The most important thing to remember is that everone is different in how they learn, but the most direct path to doing well on exams is to actually understand the material well, understand how it connects to everything else that you have learned, and to have sufficient practice with the underlying technical skills to be able to execute on demand.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>2) For many students, getting adequate sleep and rest is extremely important. \u00a0Relatedly, the general ability to concentrate and not be distracted for three hours straight is really important. So, don&#39;t shoot yourself in the foot by going into sleep debt, not eating properly, or allowing yourself to cultivate habits of distraction. Being able to do one thing at a tiMaking your own me for a long time isn&#39;t something that will just work on exams when you&#39;ve spent all the time earlier in 3 minute work bursts interrupted by texts, youtube videos, etc... Marathoners don&#39;t train by just doing sprints.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>3) Don&#39;t try to learn everything at the last minute. Really try to understand everything as the homeworks flow week by week. Don&#39;t just assume that you&#39;ll understand things better later. Ask the TAs and Profs for help earlier rather than later.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>4) In furtherance of your underlying understanding, the following approaches are woefully underused:</p>\n<ul><li>Making your own problems about the material, solving them, and sharing them with others.</li><li>It is often said that the best way to really learn something is to teach it. So, in general, doing versions of what the TAs and Profs do is a good idea. Make your own exam. Think about the concepts in the course, how they connect to other material in prereq courses and follow-on courses (ask your TAs or Prof if you do not understand this), and then try to make questions that hit those connections. After doing the practice exams as practice, deconstruct the problems and ask how you could make a similar question yourself?\u00a0</li><li>Pretend you are inside the material and understand how it fits together from the perspective of the computer or the math itself. Engage your artistic and imaginative side: try to escape the bounds of your individual human experience by stretching your ability to identify with the subject. \u00a0Don&#39;t be afraid to be silly. And don&#39;t be cynical --- every time you are cynical, you are just putting emotional distance between yourself and the material. That is not going to help you. The material has to become like a close friend --- you can get mad at it and frustrated at times, but you have to let yourself care and be vulnerable if you are going to really get close.</li><li>Play &#34;stump your friend&#34; with someone you care about and trust --- test each other about the material in a way that helps them understand better but don&#39;t destroy their confidence. If you end up stumping yourself, this is fine. Figure it out together. \u00a0</li><li>Don&#39;t be restricted to what you can see on the computer screen. Print stuff out and write stuff out by hand. Lay out the material in your own way so that it spatially spans many pages and you can see it all together spread out around you.

(Faculty who visit from elsewhere often give us comments though, because they can see what we are doing underneath the surface that you perceive.) For example, 16AB were literally put together with cutting-edge research in mind (and new ways were developed research-style for the course itself), and the goal of innoculating students with the right patterns of thought to be able to participate and absorb the things that are coming down the pike. Not just 16AB --- some of the problems in CS70 as well are abstracted from ideas that arose in research contexts. DS8 is the same way. However, the connections between the research and the problems are sometimes obscured because the first duty of homework and lecture is to be digestible by students and help them grow (even if this growth sometimes leaves you a bit sore).\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The connections to research become slightly more visible in upper-division courses like 126, 127, 121, 123, 189, etc...

That is why a high degree of faith and trust in your instructors is so important in education. \u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Anyway, the fastest way to get access to a bit of the feel of the integration between research and teaching in the lower division is to join the content team for a course.

There are also other qualitatively distinct code families, namely the polar codes, LDPC codes, and turbo codes, that are increasingly popular today in cutting-edge applications. To understand LDPC and Turbo code constructions and implementations, you need to understand more about message-passing inference algorithms as well as things like linear programming and optimization. To understand polar codes, you need more information theory (EE229A) as well.

Reading ahead in the 70 notes certainly helps to learn/understand the concepts, but spending time working on 188 problems would likely\u00a0help more in building familiarity.</p>", "created": "2017-02-14T01:04:54Z", "bucket_order": 26, "bucket_name": "Week 2/12 - 2/18", "type": "followup", "uid": "h69mwtr4j7461h", "children": [], "no_answer": 0, "id": "iz4ttoqj5sf4o8", "updated": "2017-02-14T01:04:54Z", "config": {}}, {"anon": "no", "folders": [], "data": {"embed_links": null}, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>For a subset of some opinions of other students answering the same question.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/631097886985088/permalink/747604238667785/\">https://www.facebook.com/groups/631097886985088/permalink/747604238667785/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/631097886985088/permalink/701382446623298/\">https://www.facebook.com/groups/631097886985088/permalink/701382446623298/</a>\u00a0(Note that Dibyo&#39;s comment no longer applies)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/berkeleycs/permalink/580910152003862/\">https://www.facebook.com/groups/berkeleycs/permalink/580910152003862/</a></p>", "created": "2017-02-14T01:47:15Z", "bucket_order": 26, "bucket_name": "Week 2/12 - 2/18", "type": "followup", "uid": "h69mwtr4j7461h", "children": [], "no_answer": 0, "id": "iz4vc5njb242kl", "updated": "2017-02-14T01:47:15Z", "config": {}}, {"anon": "stud", "folders": [], "data": {"embed_links": null}, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "I would personally say no no.

My favourite parts of the course were actually controls and signals, which I didn&#39;t even know were a thing before taking the courses. And even the circuits module is taught in a much different way from what most high school students are used to seeing. The rules of how to solve circuits are laid out in a very clear, logical way, and the professors take every opportunity to tie circuits concept back to linear algebra.

The problem I was working on had something to do with quantum algorithms. I realized that the problem could be solved using the Discrete Fourier Transform, which is one of the big topics in EE 16B. I&#39;m pretty sure that was not the intended way to solve the problem, but my knowledge of 16B material helped me do it anyway! And there are countless other examples of places where EE 16AB material will come in handy, such as the Singular Value Decomposition and Principal Component Analysis in CS 189 and the Fast Fourier Transform algorithm in CS 170, to name a few. Not to mention the fact that 16AB will give you experience working with IPython notebooks, which have been an immensely useful tool for me when doing data-analysis type projects.

It isn&#39;t about needing prior exposure to the concepts. The concepts are introduced in 70 one at a time.

We expect all students to get stuck every week, but we want them to get stuck on the specific concepts and techniques that we are teaching them, not to get stuck because they are having trouble at a more basic level.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>"}], "type": "i_answer", "tag_endorse_arr": [], "config": {}, "is_tag_endorse": false}], "tag_good_arr": [], "no_answer": 0, "id": "izdiyftb7nd6x6", "config": {}, "status": "active", "upvote_ids": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "bookmarked": 10, "num_favorites": 0, "my_favorite": false, "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "q_edits": [], "i_edits": [], "s_edits": [], "t": 1509626119710, "default_anonymity": "no"}

For example when we don&#39;t see many women in STEM fields, both at student and professor levels, we believe that its because women are less qualified or may not be smart enough to pursue those fields in great numbers.

The nouveau rich in China\u00a0afford better tutors and better schools, and inequality is growing rapidly there. In\u00a0the US, those economic stressors are split even more among racial groups, due to a long and complicated history with race and immigration in the US.

Is the current system equal? Obviously not. Can it be made equal? We can try. Does a merit-based system fix this? No, it has never worked anywhere. So what should we do?

What percentage of the people you know in CS/EECS are also white/Asian males?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Have you stopped to consider that perhaps the reason you and the people you know don&#39;t think this is an issue is because you and the people you know are not the ones who are affected by gender/racial issues in tech?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>How many women and underrepresented minorities in CS/EECS have you gone up to and asked, &#34;Have you ever felt unwelcome or not included in CS/EECS? Do you think there are gender or racial biases in tech?&#34;.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I&#39;m definitely not saying that you need to 100% believe without question anything a woman or underrepresented minority is saying. However, your attitude here that, &#34;I&#39;ve never experienced or heard of it, therefore it does not exist or is not important,&#34; is very hurtful. In addition, how do you know that &#34;most CS/EECS students&#34; don&#39;t care about this? Where are your statistics? And for those saying that, &#34;this issue doesn&#39;t affect me and most CS students, so why are we talking about it?&#34; - if something is wrong, don&#39;t we need to act on it regardless of whether it affects 1% of CS/EECS of 100% of it?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I, and many of the women I&#39;ve met, definitely think there are gender biases in tech. I&#39;ve personally experienced several times my male GSIs or classmates assuming that I&#39;m less competent because I&#39;m a girl. I&#39;ve also heard women who worked at famous tech companies such as Amazon and Apple talk about how they would get comments from their male coworkers about pregnancy, about what they were wearing, and comments calling them aggressive. In addition, if you want an example of sexism in tech profoundly affecting someone&#39;s career, you only need read the recent blog post written by the Uber engineer.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Often, women and underrepresented minorities are also at a disadvantage because they are discouraged from pursuing STEM or lack the well-funded schools or college-educated parents that would allow them to take advanced STEM classes before college. Do you really think that everyone is on completely equal footing and that the lack of women and underrepresented minorities in tech is really &#34;just people gravitating towards fields they&#39;re interested in,&#34; as one poster put it? As opposed to, say, people getting discouraged from pursuing CS/EECS because they feel unwelcome or biased against by other people in the field? Or because they are coming into Berkeley without any coding experience and without the benefit of the strong STEM background that others might have, and end up not being able to keep up?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>On the issue of merit, I agree that if one person is clearly more qualified than the other, the less qualified person should not be hired over the more qualified person simply due to gender or race. I also want to be taught by the best (Though, if two applicants for a TA position are about equally qualified, would it be so bad to choose the woman/underrepresented minority since they would be able to provide a unique perspective? Does having a different perspective which allows them to relate to the experiences of other female/underrepresented minority students, and enrich the perspectives of all students, not count as a teaching strength as well?). I am not suggesting that &#34;let&#39;s have qualified people, but also add women/minorities even if they&#39;re not qualified,&#34; as OP put it. I agree that if there is a shortage of more qualified women and underrepresented minorities, we need to instead focus on fixing the shortage problem - which is why it&#39;s so important that people recognize that many women and underrepresented minorities are not pursuing CS/EECS not because they simply aren&#39;t interested, but because they feel unwelcome in the field, or didn&#39;t have the educational opportunities they needed to succeed in the field. The first step to fixing the shortage is recognizing that this is in fact a legitimate issue.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In addition, why are you assuming that people are completely unbiased and fair when judging a person&#39;s merit? Studies have shown that science faculty view male applicants as significantly more competent and hireable compared to female applicants with identical applications (<a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/109/41/16474.abstract\">http://www.pnas.org/content/109/41/16474.abstract</a>). In the example OP brought up regarding the female student suggesting including a woman on the interview board, it&#39;s not black and white. It&#39;s not that our only options are to have an all-male board, or to add an unqualified female. Have you considered that perhaps there is a qualified female student in the organization who could be added to the board, and that she isn&#39;t on the board because gender bias caused the board members to view her as less qualified then she actually is, or because the board members tended to recruit their male friends? Not saying that this is in fact the case, but how can you be sure that they judged the merit of 100% of the members in the organization 100% fairly?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In conclusion, I just want to say that I agree with a lot of the points you all brought up. Most of the people I&#39;ve met in CS/EECS have been great people. Hiring should be based on merit - though merit is often not judged fairly, and being able to provide a unique perspective could be considered meritable as well. Students should be able to vote on topics for town halls. Budget/waitlists is a very important problem. However, I don&#39;t understand why you felt the need to dismiss gender/racial issues in tech, which, even though they may not affect you personally, are very important as well.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I am not, as OP is saying, &#34;complaining &#39;my group is underrepresented in tech so hire me though I&#39;m not qualified&#39;&#34; because I don&#39;t want to &#34;do the work and get the job fairly.&#34; I think the fact that I came into Berkeley with no coding experience and a weak STEM background due to lack of educational opportunities, but am now a CS and Physics double major with research experience and an internship offer is enough to prove that. What I am saying is that pretending that there are no biases at all and everyone has completely equal chances of succeeding in tech and anyone who says otherwise is just playing the victim card - that&#39;s a very hurtful attitude, especially to those who are affected by these issues. I <em>am</em> one of those affected by these issues, so I hope reading my post and hearing my perspective may have changed your views somewhat.</p>\n<p></p>", "created": "2017-02-27T00:19:16Z", "bucket_order": 38, "bucket_name": "Week 2/26 -

And this is made\u00a0worse\u00a0by the relative lack of female leaders and role models in tech. Girls grow up thinking they don&#39;t belong in tech, and this is why they choose other, more stereotypically feminine careers such as medicine or nursing, over tech.

And as for working hard: there&#39;s no affirmative action for SAT scores or GPA, and Berkeley does not practice affirmative action in admissions. I myself got the test scores needed to get into Berkeley with a scholarship, despite having a weak educational background (my formal education ended with the second grade), then the GPA needed to declare the CS major and the skills needed to get research positions and an internship. How did I work any less hard to get where I am than any of those white/Asian males you&#39;re talking about in your last paragraph? Do you still want to imply that all of them are working harder than I am and I&#39;m still just playing the victim?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Second of all, when did I ever say that women and underrepresented minorities are the ONLY ones who can be disadvantaged? I&#39;m Asian-American myself, so I definitely aware that there have been cases of racism against Asians in tech (see the U.S. Department of Labor suing Palantir for anti-Asian discrimination, and Trump&#39;s top advisor, Steve Bannon, saying that there are too many Asian CEOs in Silicon Valley, when in fact Asians are underrepresented in management \u2014 and you&#39;re still advocating for re-electing Trump?). I also know that many Asian-Americans come from impoverished families with parents who may be refugees or who haven&#39;t even completed high school degrees, and that people of all genders and races can come from poor backgrounds with lack of educational opportunities. I&#39;m not saying that if someone is a white/Asian male, they automatically face 0 problems, ever.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>However, as a white/Asian guy in tech, you will never get comments from your coworkers about what you&#39;re wearing, or messages from your boss harassing you for sex. You will never get coworkers telling you how unfair it is that you get a &#34;vacation&#34; when in fact you&#39;re taking maternity leave to have a child. You will never get your classmates or GSIs assuming that you&#39;re less competent, ignoring what you&#39;re saying, interrupting you to tell you things you already know,\u00a0 and asking you whether you&#39;re sure you&#39;re in the right classroom, just because you&#39;re a girl in a dress. You will never look around the room and feel like you&#39;re the odd one out and like you shouldn&#39;t even be here.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Is it true that some women and underrepresented minorities don&#39;t make it in tech because they&#39;re not interested or don&#39;t work hard enough? Definitely. But are you really going to say that white/Asian males just naturally have <i>so</i> much more interest and <i>so</i> much better of a work ethic that it&#39;s the ONLY reason why they make up the majority of tech? If you think about it, wouldn&#39;t it be more logical to conclude that there are also other factors at play \u2014 such as gender/racial biases, feeling unwelcome in tech, and some races being statistically more likely to be disadvantaged than others?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Lastly, whether or not the majority thinks &#34;my group is underrepresented in tech so hire me though I&#39;m not qualified&#34; is the right way to go (and how do you know that&#39;s true; where are your statistics?) \u2014 I don&#39;t care. My opinion here is that no one gets a free pass. Everyone has to work hard if they want to succeed. But what you&#39;re failing to recognize here is that it&#39;s not a level playing field. It&#39;s not true that everyone has completely equal chances of succeeding, and that if someone doesn&#39;t succeed it&#39;s always because they didn&#39;t work hard enough, and never because of other factors.

Think about it logically. If the department wanted to understand the full breadth and scope of student concerns, and wanted to do so over the course of multiple town halls, then what would be a better strategy?</p>\n<p>A) Having each town hall be completely open and free-form as to topic, thereby getting lots of people voicing the same issues over and over again.\u00a0</p>\n<p>B) Having a general town hall, student surveys, followed by topic-specific town hall meetings so that a broader scope of student concerns can be heard.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>(Optional technical exercise: in what ways is this like or unlike the use of linear vs nonlinear signaling for communicating over a noisy channel? If you get to use a noisy channel repeatedly to communicate a single Gaussian random variable, how does the performance scale with linear approaches? What scaling can you get with nonlinear approaches?)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The issue of course offerings and increasing the TA budget have already been discussed. There are things being done trying to resolve this and fundamentally, those are about getting campus to give faculty slots and TA money to the department. Inclusivity, on the other hand, is incredibly important and had not been discussed nearly enough. EECS values inclusion. Language like &#34;victim card&#34; and the like might seem like mere rhetorical flourishes to some of you, but such language and behavior acts as a way to exclude many people. Humans have feelings and are social creatures. Exclusion/inclusion is not some third-order effect for systems of interacting humans.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>(Optional technical exercise, in case simple decency of being inclusive isn&#39;t enough: when one is designing a control system that has multiple state dimensions and dynamics that couple them, is the optimal control strategy going to be to only consider the dimension of the state that you care about? Why or why not?)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The rigor of thinking that the EECS department wishes to inculcate in its students is not limited to questions involving software or circuits or devices or mathematical models that we give you. The goal is for you to be able to think critically and rigorously about problems in general. One of the important principles here is not assuming that everyone else is a fool. It&#39;s alright to not understand something. That&#39;s normal. You might question something because it doesn&#39;t make sense to you. That&#39;s also good. But to jump from there to assume that the people in charge are in the grips of something nefarious like &#34;Political Correctness&#34; isn&#39;t logical. It&#39;s arrogant. *Humility* is a vital attribute for engineers. Approach questions sincerely. *Arrogance* can be fatal in practice. \u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>It is good that you appreciate your TAs. And it is good that you have high esteem for your faculty. But you should also have some trust that these same good TAs and faculty are trying to achieve something when we want to understand how to improve inclusivity.

From your first post:</p>\n<pre>&#34;When [a female student]\u00a0suggested including a woman on the interview board for one of these organizations\u00a0<strong>she was told that &#34;men and women don&#39;t interview differently&#34; so there\u2019s no need to include a woman on the board, and that she should &#34;stop pulling the girl card for everything</strong>.&#34;\nWhat&#39;s so controversial here? People should be chosen based on merits, not gender. ALL\u00a0people are created equal. This includes people of all genders, sexualities and ethnic backgrounds.</pre>\n<p>Women are often scrutinized more critically\u00a0than men. Interviews are essential the scrutiny of an individual. A\u00a0woman\u2019s likability in the workplace isn\u2019t tied to her knowledge or boldness or ability to lead, instead, she is rewarded for projecting warmth but penalized for seeming ambitious (more <a href=\"https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/stanford-gsb-experience/news-history/gender-related-material-new-core-curriculum\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>). Employees must be seen as likable as well as skilled to be hired or promoted\u2014competence alone is insufficient. We might like to think we live in a meritocracy (standardized by technical coding interviews, perhaps), but there are many fundamental attribution errors we as humans make.\u00a0More generally, it is easy to think that\u00a0attitude(s)\u00a0\u2192\u00a0behavior, but that misses many essential pieces\u2013like social\u00a0norms, behavior\u00a0control, and implicit attitudes. Institutionalized sexism is real, but there are things we can do to lessen the effects it has.<br /></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Products are also built for both men and women (generally).

I&#39;ve presented at a faculty retreat, met with the chancellor and have spent a lot of time with faculty and staff talking about culture, climate, TAing and education. I am a slightly above average height white cis-gendered male from a stable family raised in a moderately affluent town. I had the full support of parents to attend school, but also received some financial aid. I wear metal framed glasses and shorts, and based on all this I could so incredibly easily disappear in the sea of CS students. I like that actually, there&#39;s comfort in being able to disappear. However, I also have a somewhat hidden and certainly not very obvious disability- I&#39;m very visually impaired. It affects things you wouldn&#39;t expect. <br /><br />I have since graduated, but continue to work part time with Dan Garcia on CS Education projects and have lunch with faculty.<br /><br />That&#39;s probably the most important bits, and far too long, sorry. <br /><br />---<br /> To the OP: What you feel is natural and understandable. I&#39;ve been there too. You are not wrong that waitlists and the pressure to graduate on time and take courses are real and important struggles. We all face them too. I am not going to try to quantify which of these issues are most important. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s helpful to - because there are no good objective ways to measure the relative size and importance of these issues. People are all affected to different degrees by these issues, and even if based something solely on a survey, we can&#39;t ignore issues that receive less votes -- they deserve time too regardless of their nature. <br /><br />On the particular aspect of dealing with course sizes and waitlists: Rest assured that your concerns are understood by everyone, and there is not a day that has gone by in the past few years where faculty and staff are not concerned by this issue. <br /><br />Diversity and inclusion are not merely about being politically correct. When a group is marginalized, it&#39;s important to make a conscious effort include marginalized groups and individuals otherwise you end up with a tyranny of the majority. This is not always by direct actions of the major, but simply by indirect privileges that come from strength in numbers. (In some cases, i.e. Slavery, internment camps, disenfranchisement and voting laws the actions are actually very explicit...) When only one Black student walks across the stage at graduation, we need to make sure we&#39;re aware that they aren&#39;t the only black student who was capable of studying CS. Under this logic, I am very much agreeing that the UC Berkeley Campus as whole would benefit from having more politically conservative students. As much as I really do despite the current Republican platform, we benefit from the ability to discuss with and learn from differently minded individuals. <br /><br />As a TA, I relished the opportunity to speak with and indeed learn from from students who brought view points I&#39;d never considered. Some of these were senior english majors comparing CS to writing, others were women sharing their general college experiences. I&#39;m not going to totally address the importance of diversity, because this is long enough, but there are numerous reports about &#34;the business case for diversity&#34; that provide a good starting point. Furthermore, we can&#39;t blame a lack of diversity on individuals or on external factors. At some point, this has turned into the &#34;pipeline problem&#34;, which ultimately comes down to family choices and circumstances of upbringing, and since no one can control those - blaming the pipeline leads to the logical conclusion that this is no one&#39;s problem to solve. No one has ownership of the pipeline, because we&#39;re part of the collective pipe-circle (?) of life. Many studies have shown that the reason there are less women in CS fields is not because they are less interested, but that they self-select out due to various cultural reasons. These women (or young girls in many cases) show interest in science long before they choose another field.<br /><br />These town halls are important, because these issues that are being described have been prevalent for a long while. They are now coming to a head because I believe there is a critical mass of marginalized individuals. In my 5&#43; years, this was the first time I&#39;ve seen a discussion as large as this, and one that is sincerely interested in making progress. In my own experience, the number of students with disability accommodations in CS is way lower than you would expect based on campus statistics. I&#39;ve had many remarks made to me about accommodations giving me an unfair advantage despite there being legal mandates and procedures which are (for the most part) internationally consistent. (Not all accommodations are, but mine are fairly standard.) Yes, I got 1.5x time on exams and sat in a different room. Usually. No, it&#39;s not as glorious and you think, and no you most certainly do not want to specifically schedule every freaking exam. Nor do you want the SATs to take two days, for example. I&#39;m grateful that faculty are accommodating and in most cases willing to learn. But it&#39;s an uphill battle. Sometimes it&#39;s far easier to just forgo any legally mandated accommodations and pretend to be normal, nasty headaches or lower scores be dammed. <br />I don&#39;t want to sound like I&#39;m complaining, but I&#39;m not trying to. My visual impairment is very manageable and even the awkwardness that it does impose could be far worse. My point is that most people cannot see this.<br /><br />I cannot see, nor can I truly understand all the struggles that some people may go through to attend Berkeley. It may be the many additional jobs (for which my lazy ass probably couldn&#39;t handle), or it may jus be the way that others are treated by their peers or something else. <strong>It is entirely within our control, however, to create a place where these factors are mitigated and where we learn to address them. </strong>This doesn&#39;t mean affirmative action necessarily, or any particular policy - but by doing nothing would be systematically harm a bunch of different individuals in a bunch of different ways.<br /><br /><br />As a point of clarification: As it stands right now CA Prop 209 passed by voters in 1996, an anti-discrimination law, forbids affirmative action policies by higher education institutions. (Among other things). So, yes, considering race for admissions is currently illegal. But, consequently, allowing discrimination is also illegal. While I&#39;m not aware of any codified department policies that would constitute illegal discrimination, I do believe that we have a social culture which allows such actions to continue. We have course policies and course designs (both implicit and explicit) that can lead to unintended discrimination.<br /><br />It&#39;s also simply unfair to equate improving diversity with lowering bar. Many of the (often small) gains that STEM departments and tech companies have seen in improving diversity are not through changing standards, but simply doing more to reach out to and search for groups that are typically not included. We can go to black students, or disabled students, or women or whomever and say &#34;I think you might enjoy computer science. It&#39;s a really interesting subject that you probably haven&#39;t had a chance to explore, but here&#39;s why it&#39;s awesome. If you like it, I want to make sure that we&#39;ll do what we can to make sure you feel like a part of the community.&#34; It might feel like awkward special treatment at first, but the goal isn&#39;t to do this forever, necessarily. The goal is do this until we have an equitable community. The reason accommodations for disabled students exist, is to level the playing field - so to speak. Many of the marginalized groups come from backgrounds where they never had access to computer science, for any number of reasons. Though not a physical or learning disability, a lack of access to the traditional support structures is very much a handicap in one&#39;s education. If we believe that discrimination is immoral, then so would it be immoral to not address these systemic problems. <br /><br />At the end of the day, some of these resources we are talking about (such as time and money) are finite. And if we are talking about moving money from one student org to another, you&#39;re right to be concerned about the opportunity costs such a move would present. In the case of funds, I think there are two things consider:<br />a) every financial allocation is a different story, a different beast with different trade-offs. It&#39;s not worth too much effort considering the abstract case here, because the implementation is vitally important. There are outcomes which might benefit everyone in unexpected ways.<br />b) On principle, if we assume that money is to be spent in a way that is equally beneficial to all students, then we need to examine whether we are currently achieving that goal. Some folks have very clearly demonstrated that existing structures (a la HKN) do not support their needs -- and they are just as much entitled to XYZ as we are to HKN.<br /><br /><em>Edit: The last section was eaten by\u00a0Piazza.

What\u2019s not natural, is recognizing that discrimination exists, but ignoring to do anything about it.<br /> <br /> What\u2019s different about the issues now, is that there are a critical mass of a bunch of different marginalized groups. Keep in mind that not everyone at these town halls and social hours is experiencing the same struggles and difficulties. It\u2019s a wide range of issues, but there are very common unifying elements that I believe demand the attention of everyone in our community. While I was not at this town hall, I was at the one immediately prior, and so far these have been the two best attended town halls in my recent memory.

Just like the ol&#39; days.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Perverse Incentives to Lie.</p>\n<p>I like to think of this the same way I deal with cheating as a TA/Instructor. My experience is that most people don&#39;t cheat, and most cheating doesn&#39;t tip the scales in a significant way. Regardless of whether you add race or gender to the mix, what we&#39;re talking about is people cheating an application system. People can (and do) do this already. However, the question is about prevalence and the how effective the cheating is.\u00a0Most people don&#39;t lie, and those who do lie about their race or socioeconomic status or fabricate essays for college were probably not as strong of applicants to being with. I also very much fundamentally believe that most \u00a0people are well intentioned and not evil. That helps me stay grounded at times..because:</p>\n<p>People lying to gain an advantage is a real problem. Turns out, for a nominal sum of cash (say $1500) it&#39;s pretty easy to get certified as having ADHD. Aside from the access to prescription drugs, this enables people to unfairly apply for disability accommodations. 150% time on a test can certainly be an advantage when you&#39;re not using it to overcome a disability. The result of this, is that getting accommodations can be excessively difficult. It took nearly a year (and letters and phone calls from my parents to many people at the College Board) to get approved, and they still eff&#39;d up my SATs and AP tests many times.<br /><br />So, the consequences of these actions are real. To me, the solution is that if you find someone is lying or cheating, you punish them. When it comes to race (and even more so, gender identity) is can be difficult and touchy to verify, but if a company has a problem that is so bad to the point where they need to take these measures, I think they can communicate with applicants about their process. I would much rather see process try to adapt to be equitable, and then correct their mistakes instead of trying nothing at all. \u00a0In my view: if an application asks for a gender, and it&#39;s progressive enough to even include an option for transgender, I just can&#39;t fathom that many people (I just say it...) are fucked up enough to co-opt the incredible struggles of the trans community for their own gain? I&#39;m not saying it won&#39;t happen, but until it happens on a big scale, I personally think \u00a0the impact that you make by being equitable would outweigh the potential costs.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>However, the other option is to change the incentive structure. Getting a job will always have a high financial incentive to it, but I think it just means that we have to adjust the process to lower the stakes. I read that the average American now has 10 jobs before they&#39;re 40. This hopefully means that landing in the wrong first job won&#39;t be such a deal. It&#39;s part education and part process change that I think can ultimately solve the problems.\u00a0<br /><br />On programs that are only for a certain race or group:<br />I don&#39;t personally have strong feelings about these overall. My personal belief is that the more we interact with others not like us, the more we will collectively understand each other better. However, programs that cater to a specific demographic and be extremely successful. In the space on early-CS education there are a number of programs such as CODE2040, Black Girls Code, AppCamp for Girls, Level the Playing Field Institute. These programs are, in part, able to achieve success by simply removing the racial, gender, economic and other tensions so so they can focus on their goals of teaching \u00a0programming. \u00a0In think internship and scholarship programs that are structured the same way are also a necessary component of progress. They give people opportunities they otherwise wouldn&#39;t have. And in terms of resources, I don&#39;t think those programs typically take away spots from everyone else - I think they&#39;re more of an additive thing. Like &#34;we&#39;re going to do this extra effort because we believe in this case&#34;, such that if not centered around a gender/ethic/etc issue, then there wouldn&#39;t be a replacement program.\u00a0</p>", "created": "2017-03-04T07:47:24Z", "bucket_order": 38, "bucket_name": "Week 2/26 - 3/4", "type": "feedback", "uid": "grqtsu85iy0", "children": [], "id": "izuy4n03d2l3ut", "updated": "2017-03-04T07:47:24Z", "config": {}}, {"anon": "stud", "folders": [], "data": {"embed_links": null}, "children": [], "subject": "<p>Michael, thank you for writing such a detailed answer.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I would disagree that the programs you mention remove racial/gender/economic tensions.

However, I sincerely doubt that these programs do increase racial, economic or other divides in a meaningful way. Why is OK to group &#39;disadvantaged&#39; into one large group or to not consider race? I would agree that socioeconomic status is probably a better indicator of disadvantage, but it&#39;s so intertwined with race, that I don&#39;t think it matters much in aggregate.\u00a0</p>\n<p>But furthermore, &#39;disadvantaged&#39; is a catch-all term, like marginalized that captures dozens and dozens of different disadvantages. While the blind and visually impaired have instances of discrimination and microaggressions, they&#39;re not same struggles that black youth, or Latinxs, or any other group face, even though they&#39;re in a similar category.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Specific programs give people a place to share and grow and hopefully include support without the discomfort of needing to explain to others the struggles they&#39;ve encountered. For example, while I would\u00a0to teach CS at many of them, my presence would be an active distraction for many of the students.<br /><br />If as a society, we segregated ourselves all the time, in every way, then you&#39;re right that&#39;d we probably be in a worse position overall. But programs that address a specific group aren&#39;t designed to replace people&#39;s interaction with others - they&#39;re a temporary. Someone who goes through an internship targeted at women, will almost certainly be working with and interacting with and possibly\u00a0even dating men then or in the future.

What do you think when you walk by a homeless person, or see a group of African American dancers on BART, or someone using a red and white cane, etc, etc? Some of these things you and I probably think are normal, but\u00a0for some of them we\u00a0have instinctive reactions we probably don&#39;t even notice.

opinion]</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The point of the classes\u00a0that EECS offers is to, collectively, help you become a better engineer (and scholar, should you go on for graduate study) over the course of a 40&#43; year career. Ideally, a Berkeley style engineer who can work on things that push the boundaries and not just filling in the blanks. \u00a0Engineers who can contribute to make society better and advancing the state of knowledge, while learning. How classes do this is by helping you think about things more clearly. When I was an undergraduate, there were things said in lecture that were never on an exam or a HW that still ended up helping me years later. If a student\u00a0thinks that a class is about doing well on the homework or on exams or getting a good grade, the student is missing the point. If the student thinks the point of the course is to teach them a particular tool that they can use in industry, they are also missing the point. They should be paying attention and trying to internalize how we are thinking.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>A Bachelor&#39;s degree is meant to prepare you for being an apprentice --- to learn productively from masters who are working\u00a0in the field. There are going to be many practical skills associated with both software engineering in general as well as particular application domains that you will have to learn in the field. In general, the time at Berkeley is precious and what you could learn better in industry should be left to be taught to you there. Details (and particular tools) are easy to learn in industry, but big pictures are harder. This is because real life has lots of details. Knowing how to remove the details and see the essence is the skill that is hard to learn in industry precisely because the essence alone is never enough. But the essence is critical for making strategic decisions. However, when people start out, they don&#39;t usually get to make strategic decisions. So there is a gap --- a time during which you are learning a lot in industry and not seeing the full advantage of your Berkeley education. This is fine from our point of view --- we are teaching you with the time-scale of decades in our mind.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>"}, {"anon": "no", "uid": "icdxydvnk125h8", "subject": "", "created": "2017-03-02T17:09:19Z", "content": "<p>guide.berkeley.edu maintains student learning goals for every major on campus</p>"}], "type": "i_answer", "tag_endorse_arr": ["icu2xhmuxxk2ub", "hzd1lhoceif2yh", "hktwxn65mvt46d", "idriks20rqg42v", "idtiecbnamq7ff", "ir6sjtqw2e51rf", "hktwxoza4lv48d", "hqvk9uiuXhZ", "icguxq47fy1e4", "hzd1mbl3gnm3vc", "is6p8idxhub7pd", "icguxwqmsgc1ic", "i54jx0frjpl2zk", "hkkhvv2dy9f4kl", "ipkfrd85xkt1zi", "iy254ru3frx5ie", "icguy040fqd1kp", "ijm8ialkfdt7pq", "idrimescdeo5hl", "hxsegbyiots7au", "is0qrwjdz4c231", "hzd1lggffoe2x7", "hzd1l5dwgyi2oh", "is6p8zl3nphb8", "is6p950uf8keh", "ijly8cfwGjP", "icguy47j9b31np", "iscem14kbsu5vi", "hktwxo5q8h547h", "hccnzx9ezt97j7"], "config": {}, "is_tag_endorse": false}, {"anon": "no", "folders": [], "data": {"embed_links": null}, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>I think Prof. Sahai&#39;s answer is a really good high-level answer.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Most of these questions also don&#39;t have specific answers -- I don&#39;t believe the CS department has specific goals for graduates other than that they are successful. But two obvious goals are the UCB CS graduates should be competitive candidates for top engineering jobs and graduate schools. However, the path to graduate school is not necessarily the same as the path to the software industry (that really depends on a lot of factors). Ideally, students should feel comfortable pursuing their dreams. (Which is admittedly cheesy, but I believe accurately so).</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Courses at Berkeley are numbered in various buckets, most coarsely: Lower division, Upper Division, Graduate Level. (0XX, 1XX, 2XX, respectively.) Within the increasing buckets you&#39;re expected to go from breadth to increasing depth on a topic.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>What I would also add, is that every (faculty member, course, semester) combination is unique in some respects. Each course (i.e. CS161) has a syllabus that&#39;s approved by campus that covers the basic concepts that are expected to be covered, but each offering may adapt as course staff\u00a0want to try different approaches or make adjusts for what may be changing goals. So, if you&#39;re curious about a particular course--just ask! Faculty (typically) love waxing poetic about their course designs and aspirations for their courses. It&#39;s no easy task, and it&#39;s always nice to hear from interested students.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Finally, I want to caution you (or anyone), that your personal learning and a life goals may not match up with those of a particular course. I took plenty of courses during my time as a student where my goals were somewhat different than the courses. In those cases I focused most strongly on the aspects that aligned well, and learned what I could from the other stuff. For smaller courses or project based ones, I made sure to take any flexibility I had, and adapt it to my interests. For example in non-CS courses I would explore problems by using small programs and data to make an argument. Naturally, writing code to finish a writing reading response isn&#39;t necessary (or something I recommend for everyone), but at the time it was a fun way to be personally and academically productive, and whenever I&#39;ve done things like professors are almost always receptive.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><br /><br /></p>", "created": "2017-03-03T08:50:59Z", "bucket_order": 39, "bucket_name": "Week 2/26 - 3/4", "type": "followup", "uid": "grqtsu85iy0", "children": [{"anon": "stud", "folders": [], "data": {"embed_links": null}, "children": [], "subject": "<p>Mr. Ball,</p>\n<p>I was interested in your comment that you wrote code to write a reading response for you.

I was in 61A at the time, and we had just learned to use dictionaries (the Python kind, of course) and so I though it would be fun to do things like word count on a couple texts we were given as well as some basic statistics and to find data to explore the same topics. It was nothing super rigorous, but I found it to be a good way to practice Python \u00a0(of which I needed lots of practice them!) and to explore the topic in a way that I figured most people would not.

Moreover, I interacted with you a bit on piazza. Let me first say, I am sorry to see that you have gone.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I am a Dad for what its worth to kids roughly your age. So, I will give a &#34;Dad&#34; story to hopefully address your question. My kids embark on eye-rolling at this point, please feel free to do so.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I was in a seminar once where Terry Tao was speaking. He was a prodigy and now is an incredibly accomplished and also incredibly generous mathematician through his blog. He was describing at a fairly high level his work with Green regarding arithmetic progressions. He was writing fairly quickly on the board, but then stopped, for a while, thirty seconds perhaps even a minute. He concentrated, perhaps even rocked slightly. He then nodded, perhaps remarked something like &#34;OK&#34;, and continued his explanation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>What was he doing?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Who knows?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But I will speculate. He was perhaps thinking about his explanation and how it fit in with the details of the proof of this epic theorem. To maintain integrity, the explanation had to be faithful to the actual proof, he could not go on without ensuring that. Moreover, he focused enough to get the details sorted in his mind and confirm that his explanation was indeed on solid ground. He did this in front of an audience that patiently awaited.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This focus and integrity is perhaps a view of what math is, and what doing it takes. He wasn&#39;t comfortable with communicating much less having a soft understanding of what was going on, he had to ensure that what he understood and communicated was true. Certainly, many details were not there, but a plan whose parts could actually be executed was laid out. Second, he was able to focus and bring these things together in those moments, in front of an audience. The combination of the desire to communicate accurately and the ability to focus to gather what context he needed into his mind to verify his explanation was amazing.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In CS70, one needs to do this on some level. For example, think about a proof of Fermat&#39;s theorem; or $$a^{p-1} = 1 \\pmod{p}$$ for non-zero $$a$$. Here, one needs to gather some ideas. Any non-zero $$a$$ has an inverse $$\\pmod p$$, as $$gcd(a,p)=1$$ when $$p$$ is prime. Thus, we can say that the set $$\\{a,2a,3a,\\ldots,(p-1)a\\}$$ consists of distint elements and thus must be the same set as $$\\{1,\\ldots,(p-1)\\}$$ modulo $$p$$. Then, we proceed by noting the product of the elements of the &#34;two&#34; sets are the same, but have different form. From here, can you finish?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In some sense, this isn&#39;t even enough to just know the basic proofs. We then ask questions like show that $$a^{(p-1)(q-1)} = 1 \\mod{pq}$$ on the exam! Here, the proof is the same, one needs to work with the set $$\\{x \\in\\{1,\\ldots pq-1\\} | gcd(x,pq) = 1\\}$$ as they have inverses and do a bit more work. Oh my! But this is fine. You can do it! Just play with the ideas, a little bijection, a little bit about inverses. Turn over the proof a couple of times to see how it works. Teach someone the proof to see if you have it. But do try to\u00a0 have it completely, if not then, eventually. Indeed, I sometimes sit up in the middle of the night because I got some aspect of some explanation wrong to some student.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>One thing though that makes this very difficult, would be doing all this while thinking about how &#34;not good&#34; at math one is. One needs to use your significant mental resources to play with the ideas not to engage in fear or self doubt.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I should note even Terry Tao had doubts at times; indeed, he was once led out of an exam room in tears.\u00a0 <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/26/magazine/the-singular-mind-of-terry-tao.html?_r=0\" target=\"_blank\">See here.</a></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Given your performance in 61A and 61B, these ideas are easily within your grasp. Just approach them calmly, and engage, you will do fine. You are welcome to continue to come to office hours and at least listen. The interactions among students, and between students and TA&#39;s may well be more fun and instructive now that the pressure is off. Choose ideas to really get and ensure you get them. Better to solidly have some than sketchily have many. It should be fun, even.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>TL;DR. For math, one should try to own the why. Focus on that, leave out yourself and specifically doubts about yourself, however hard that is. Some days we just don&#39;t get it, that&#39;s fine too.

As someone taking 70 right now I understand the dreadful &#34;shaky&#34; feeling about the material- I felt the same in the few weeks leading up to the midterm. I also sunk a lot of time into reading the notes and extra resources. However, when it came to the first two or three homeworks I was a mess- couldn&#39;t even get started on some problems, and the ones I could do I ended up getting completely wrong.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In your post you don&#39;t mention office hours, homework parties, or study groups so I&#39;m not sure if you tried those at all. If not, my advice would be to lean on those heavily next time you take it. What I found helped the most was a large amount of time face-to-face with someone who knew the material well- may that be a TA in OH who was going through the notes with me or a friend\u00a0in my study group who was working with me to construct a solution to a HW problem. This really benefited me because the other person was able to gauge my understanding real-time, help me understand the stuff I was missing, and correct any misconceptions that I had. It worked really well- I ended up getting &#43;1 std dev on the midterm. IMO learning CS 70 is a dialogue- you learn by bouncing my thoughts and ideas off other people and listening to the responses.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I agree with Prof. Sahai on the problem of self-studying- reading the notes and doing the HW in a vacuum allowed me to form these misconceptions that went unchecked until I talked it over with someone else. Perhaps you can find resources this semester to help you prepare\u00a0even though you&#39;re not in the class. I know there are clubs that offer tutoring for CS 70 (HKN comes to mind).</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Don&#39;t get yourself down on being &#34;horrible at math&#34;- this is about hard work, not intrinsic talent!

Though I really enjoyed the homeworks, I wish I had more time in the day to explore and work on hw style problems. But I have to now be realistic with how much time I actually have and I have to allocate it towards doing well on the test. After keeping up with hw I ended up not having much time to really review and practice the faster style of the midterm, i.e., less in-depth but more questions, and time limited. I tend to be more methodical and slow-thinking but enjoy solving hard problems. Fast-style test taking isn&#39;t my forte but I hope\u00a0if I prepare more for that I can do better (I&#39;ve done better on other exams that require that kind of style before, but never had weekly homeworks for those classes that required so much time -- I&#39;m doing the homework option).\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I ended up doing close to the mean on the first midterm, which for me was a huge disappointment.

My circumstances right now:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>- I am a first-year transfer majoring in EECS</p>\n<p>- This is my second semester and I have taken or am taking CS61A, B, and C, 70, and EE16A</p>\n<p>- I am a full-time student also working two part-time jobs and the ocassional freelance work</p>\n<p>- I am from a <em>very</em>\u00a0low-income family and I am the main source of income</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>My source of stress and the reason why I am considering this at all is because of the last point listed above. I currently receive full financial aid for my classes (besides the summer semester, for some reason) and the extra money I get from grants/loans along with the money from working is crucial to my family&#39;s survival. Forgive me if it sounds like I&#39;m dramatizing that, but I can&#39;t really think of a better way to put it.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This May, I will not have enough money to support my family lest we resort to living in a shelter or cramped apartment. Even then, we would not have enough money for a lot of the necessities we pay for every month. The only options I can think of are to drop out/take a semester off or attend school part-time, all in order to have time for a full-time job as a software engineer. I believe I have the necessary experience and side projects already for landing such a job, but naturally I&#39;m afraid to just drop out. The problem with taking a semester off or attending part-time is that, since I&#39;m a transfer in the engineering department, I believe I only have a limited number of semesters here before I can no longer enroll. I suppose I could petition to stay longer as another option, though.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In summary, I&#39;m considering dropping out to support my family before we go homeless. If I have the experience and confidence in my skills to land a software engineering job right now, should I go for it? Some clarification for how long an EECS transfer can attend would also be appreciated.</p>"}], "type": "question", "tags": ["other", "student"], "tag_good": [{"role": "student", "name": "Jim Brown",

Then I worked as a software engineer and was making ~$50/hour. Then I decided to go back to school after 2 years. Afterwards, I still had an offer to work part time but I decided to focus on school. Like you, I also had 0 EFC.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Your income may affect your financial aid EFC. However, if your parent/parents that you put on your FAFSA has a income under the zero EFC threshold, you will get the automatic 0 EFC. Which means that no matter how much money you earn,\u00a0if you qualify for 0 EFC, you will still get the 0 EFC.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Hypothetically, if you work part time for 20 hours a week and $30/hour, you&#39;d be making $2500 pre tax which would be good enough to cover your family expenses if you keep things budgeted. Also do keep in mind that the more money you make, the more taxes you pay so working 40 hours a week may not necessarily give you twice as much as if you had worked 20 hours a week. Working part time will probably affect your GPA but I think thats a compromise you would have to make. Also, having an internship over the summer can get you like $15k over the course of the summer which might\u00a0be enough to barely scrape by.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>One\u00a0reason for my coming back to school is that I would be able to make more money after I graduate. I&#39;d suggest that you try to find a way to make ends meet and graduate soon so that you can get a full job.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>[Warning: Next part is something most people initially won&#39;t agree with. But I&#39;m just sharing my personal experience on how I made careful decisions to make ends meet]. Contrary to what people may say, it may also be a good idea to go into debt. This is a view that I have that not many people agree with, but in\u00a0my situation, I made a calculated risk to go into (0% interest) debt in order to have more emergency cash padding. If you want to take a gamble that you will be able to find a good six figure job\u00a0after you graduate, consider going into debt. $1 today is as valuable as $0.20 in a few years.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>(As a side story, my mom passed away\u00a0within the past year meaning i am\u00a0no longer\u00a0eligible for the 0 EFC next year and my income counts against me.

Also, you can get a appeal for budget adjustment to get more financial aid.)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Feel free to ask any questions about my own experience</p>", "created": "2017-03-12T16:24:07Z", "bucket_order": 31, "bucket_name": "Week 3/12 - 3/18", "type": "followup", "children": [{"anon": "stud", "folders": [], "data": {"embed_links": null}, "children": [], "subject": "<p>Thank you for sharing this.

This allowed me to get access to about $20k in 0% interest (of course, I didn&#39;t use it all but it was something useful to have to pay for important expenses that financial aid didn&#39;t cover). Having a full time job also helped my chances of getting a credit card.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>One plan that could work for you is taking one year off of school to work as a software developer. Then while you&#39;re there, save enough to help you get through for the next two years. And perhaps, if your credit score is okay, then you could even get 0% interest credit cards. With 15-21\u00a0months of no interest (Citi Simplicity; Chase Slate; Discover 18 months), you will be able to focus on school\u00a0while also being able to survive.

Therefore, since CS 70 is part of our declaration requirement, we anyways end up taking it before EE 16A and EE 16B, which makes it useless. In regards to prepping us for other courses, a majority of CS upper division courses either don&#39;t require any knowledge of circuits or require a knowledge of circuits that runs tangential to the course material. This can be seen from the fact that 16a and 16b are very sparsely, if at all, listed as prerequisites to any CS upper division course.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>2) A basic amount of knowledge of circuits is essential to a proper CS education.</p>\n<p>I disagree with this entirely. There definitely do exist fields within CS for which a knowledge of circuits would be useful but there also exists numerous fields in CS (esp. with industrial application) that require absolutely no knowledge of circuits. And if this is the case, it seems that imposing a requirement that ALL students must know a basic amount of knowledge on circuits\u00a0would be unfair to those who have no need to use it in the future. This is the same point\u00a0that I would make as to why CS 170 and CS 162 are not required for all CS majors, even though they are extremely useful in a large proportion of fields within CS.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>3) EE 16A gives students\u00a0a better understanding of linear algebra that Math 54 that would be essential for CS majors when taking classes in the future</p>\n<p>If this is a concern, students should be offered the option of taking Math 54 &#43; Math 110 instead of Math 54 &#43; EE 16A since Math 110 also imposes a higher understanding of linear algebra.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I argue that\u00a0EE 16A should either be entirely removed as a L&amp;S CS major requirement or, as mentioned in my last point, should be replaced/substitutable with Math 110.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I would love to hear any followup discussions regarding this topic; my goal in posting this is to spark a discussion on why exactly we have this requirement for L&amp;S CS majors and hopefully either get it removed for future L&amp;S CS\u00a0majors or hear a solid explanation as to why EE 16A needs to be a requirement for all L&amp;S CS majors as opposed to an optional class that L&amp;S CS majors could take if their academic interests align with material taught in the class.</p>"}], "type": "question", "tags": ["16a", "cs", "student"], "tag_good": [{"role": "student", "name": "Christopher Lin", "admin": false, "photo": "1473543055_35.png", "id": "hz5sgc1hkxr6q", "us": false, "facebook_id": null}, {"role": "student", "name": "Hrishi Dharam", "admin": false, "photo": null, "id": "idriks20rqg42v", "us": false, "facebook_id": null}, {"role": "student", "name": "Ian McDonald", "admin": false, "photo": null, "id": "ijkkx5hy8c94h3", "us": false, "facebook_id": null}, {"role": "student", "name": "Rohan Mathuria", "admin": false, "photo": null, "id": "hktxrim2drk3da", "us": false, "facebook_id": null}, {"role": "student", "name": "Nikhil Patel", "admin": false, "photo": null, "id": "idrinkfj99i10b", "us": false, "facebook_id": null}, {"role": "student", "name": "Brian Kim", "admin": false, "photo": null, "id": "hqq77vlnchw2i7", "us": false, "facebook_id": null}], "unique_views": 559, "children": [{"folders": [], "data": {"embed_links": []}, "children": [], "created": "2017-03-20T21:42:41Z", "bucket_order": 2, "tag_endorse": [{"role": "student", "name": "Snaheth Thumathy", "admin": false, "photo": "1446078660_35.png", "id": "idtiecbnamq7ff", "us": false, "facebook_id": null}, {"role": "student", "name": "Garrett Thomas", "admin": false, "photo": null, "id": "hzd1mbl3gnm3vc", "us": false, "facebook_id": null}, {"role": "student", "name": "Will Wang", "admin": false, "photo": null, "id": "is6p6lzfa695i6", "us": false, "facebook_id": null}, {"role": "student", "name": "Jessie Yang", "admin": false, "photo": "1473565160_35.png", "id": "ib2kjvzzgc61w2", "us": false, "class_sections": ["classof2019_hyq0br1u3kx7dg"], "facebook_id": null}], "bucket_name": "Today", "id": "j0in0gjr82v6o7", "history": [{"anon": "no", "uid": "gxj8rtteeuaa9", "subject": "", "created": "2017-03-20T22:07:53Z", "content": "<p><strong attention=\"gxj8rtteeuaa9\">&#64;Anant Sahai</strong>\u00a0 <strong attention=\"gro4nnkuub\">&#64;Elad Alon</strong> \u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Anant Sahai:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Hi, I will write a more detailed answer later but first will say that I encourage you to come and talk to me to understand this better. 16AB were designed to be fundamental to the needs of all of our students in preparation for a 40-year career going forward, and L&amp;S CS students in particular. We in the faculty have a bit more experience than you do about both how fields are evolving intellectually as well as just how much things can change with time. As a student, you don&#39;t really understand the bigger picture, especially the scope of change and the need for a robust development of different ways of thinking. Which is to be expected --- otherwise, you wouldn&#39;t need the university and could just go and read books and do projects on your own to learn. The answer so far (I have to go to a meeting) is basically of the &#34;trust us&#34; variety, and there is a strong case that such trust is actually fundamental to the student/teacher relationship. Everything we say will always have a dimension of &#34;trust us&#34; to it, because you do not understand or appreciate what you cannot yet fathom. In the words of Donald Rumsfeld, it&#39;s the unknown unknowns that get you. \u00a0One of our goals is to make you more ready for them.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>"}, {"anon": "no", "uid": "hyq0c18svsu7ek", "subject": "", "created": "2017-03-20T21:42:41Z", "content": "<p><strong attention=\"gxj8rtteeuaa9\">&#64;Anant Sahai</strong>\u00a0 <strong attention=\"gro4nnkuub\">&#64;Elad Alon</strong> \u00a0</p>"}], "type": "i_answer", "tag_endorse_arr": ["idtiecbnamq7ff", "hzd1mbl3gnm3vc", "is6p6lzfa695i6", "ib2kjvzzgc61w2"], "config": {}, "is_tag_endorse": false}, {"folders": [], "data": {"embed_links": []}, "children": [], "created": "2017-03-20T22:36:25Z", "bucket_order": 2, "tag_endorse": [], "bucket_name": "Today", "id": "j0ioxk40vv24rh", "history": [{"anon": "stud", "subject": "", "created": "2017-03-22T03:37:41Z", "content": "<p>If I were to follow your logic, I would argue that R&amp;C/Breadth/HSS/AC requirements should be entirely removed from all science and engineering majors as those would have no impact nor benefit on the career of a computer scientist/engineer.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>____________________________</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Your issue is you&#39;re looking at 16AB as a circuits course, which while it teaches circuits it teaches skills more important than that, and ones that are relevant to a completely software based curriculum.

I disagree with the first student response. Breadths make sense because all L&amp;S majors are fundamentally part of a liberal arts school, which stresses a fundamental understanding of a variety of subjects that don&#39;t relate to our traditional technical curriculum. So that requirement makes sense because that&#39;s the fundamental teaching philosophy behind the entire school; this is why breadths reqs. vary between schools. On the other hand, EE 16a is a major requirement, which means it should (in principle) relate to our specific technical curriculum.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Prof. Sahai: I appreciate your quick response! I&#39;d love to hear your more detailed answer and maybe follow up in person if necessary, but I just want to point out that my post doesn&#39;t come from a point of conceit but rather from a point of relative frustration. That is, I\u00a0agree entirely that professors would have a much more thorough understanding of the fields and understand what is and isn&#39;t useful to teach us, but often times it may be frustrating from a student&#39;s perspective if we&#39;re told to learn something that seems tangential to everything else we learn when we don&#39;t have an understanding of the bigger picture in mind.

At the most basic visceral level, it is comfort in solving problems step by step and maintaining confidence in your work even as you take steps forward. For 70, you need comfort and familiarity with doing simple proofs and derivations as well. What we observe even in 16AB is that when students come in, many are so used to getting answers immediately (which is what so much of high school and standardized testing have primed you for) that they freeze up when faced with a problem that does not have an immediately visible path to the solution. Some students do one level better, in that they start trying random things but their confidence quickly dissipates as they take steps that don&#39;t land on the answer itself. Where you need to be emotionally (at a minimum) for 70 coming in is to maintain confidence, execute simple things correctly, be able to be precise in talking about concepts, and have some intuitive sense for when progress is being made. Learning mathematical maturity is sometimes kind of painful, but this is pain that you must experience to progress.

However, it is perfectly possible to conceive of a (better) form of 120 in which that dependence is very strong and is not just about mathematical maturity or linear algebra in general, but down into the specific topics and concepts taught in 16B. For example, by explicitly leveraging the finite-dimensional stories in 16B as the jumping off point for the infinite-dimensional stories told in 120.\u00a0</p>"}, {"anon": "no", "uid": "hyq0c18svsu7ek", "subject": "", "created": "2017-05-10T21:21:33Z", "content": "<p><strong attention=\"gxj8rtteeuaa9\">&#64;Anant Sahai</strong>\u00a0 <strong attention=\"gro4nnkuub\">&#64;Elad Alon</strong>\u00a0 any insights here?\u00a0</p>"}], "type": "i_answer", "tag_endorse_arr": [], "config": {}, "is_tag_endorse": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["hzab6kpr3c048h"], "no_answer": 0, "id": "j1s4nbiyzh35z4", "config": {}, "status": "active", "upvote_ids": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "bookmarked": 7, "num_favorites": 0, "my_favorite": false, "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "q_edits": [], "i_edits": [], "s_edits": [], "t": 1509626144644, "default_anonymity": "no"}

To this audience, they are designed to help advance their skill in thinking about information and how it connects to the real world, building a solid foundation in concrete linear algebra (of Euclidean n-space and complex c-space) along the way. The 16AB series are designed to be modern and to be the right lower-division introduction in a world that has ML as an important topic that many students will engage with.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The circuits content in 16AB (static linear circuits in 16A and dynamic circuits in 16B along with transistors as switches with parasitics) is designed to do two things. First, be synergistic with the overall themes of thinking (modeling, design thinking, breaking problems into smaller parts, mapping things to mathematics, etc...) and linear algebra in the rest of the course. There is a purely pedagogical purpose here. Second, to expose students to circuits as an alternative perspective on understanding information processing, with a particular focus on the interface to the real world. We believe that this alternative perspective and the mental muscles it develops is vital since a purely imperative or symbolic-functional perspective on information processing is too limiting for a 40-year career, especially as we consider\u00a0how information can be processed by things like neural networks both of the present and in the future.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The dynamical behavior perspective in 16B is also very important as we think about a future of robots, etc. and the introductory treatment of control theory is meant to convey some insight about how the combination of information processing and a physical system can result in a new combined physical systems that behaves differently. This kind of thinking, we believe, is going to be increasingly vital. It is not enough to think of a robot at the level of a physical system that obeys commands. Instead, we have to accept that the very nature of how the robot reacts to the world is intertwined with the information processing that we engineer.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The linear-algebraic material includes perspectives on casting problems as optimizations (including linear regression and minimum energy control) and detailed discussions of things like choices of coordinates, PCA (also a kind of optimization perspective) and the SVD, along with an exploration of how time-invariant structure in linear operators creates symmetries that can be exploited in the right coordinate systems. Most of the heavier lifting is done in 16B with the preliminaries introduced in 16A. The treatment of differential equations in 16B is consequently also very linear-algebra centered, and follows the paradigm of showing how the simple 1d case generalizes to higher dimensions with eigenstructure playing the starring role. \u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The default choice is that a student takes 16A and then 16B and then 70. That&#39;s how we intend students to take these courses. The introduction of 16AB in the freshman year allows upper division courses to adapt and improve because they can now count on these perspectives as well as the understanding that they provide. 189, for example, starting next semester will just take 16B for granted.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>What do you need for 16B from 16A?

I&#39;m assuming you are going to be taking 70 in the summer/fall? If so, here are my thoughts:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Execution trumps consumption; reading the notes is not enough, as the 2nd anon below has said. There&#39;s no shortcut- you have to spend a lot of time toying with the material in a variety of different ways. The exact amount may differ from person to person. This is what works for me.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I read the notes early in the week, and I go to office hours to help clear up anything I don&#39;t understand. This usually involves sketching out some proofs with the TA- it&#39;s an active, not passive, process on my end. I also start on the homework alone. I answer what I can answer and keep thinking about the stuff I can&#39;t.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I go to every discussion- don&#39;t skip out on these! It gives you two extra hours a week to tackle problems with other people around you- you may find yourself learning about a new approach, or explaining your approach to a classmate. And the TA is there to help clarify anything you feel shaky on or guide you to a solution. Don&#39;t sit in the back, fill in answers and check your phone for the rest of the time. Work with your classmates on every problem in the sheet. Ask your TA for help whenever you need it. They are there for you, you should be demanding their attention. Shoutout to Ben Kha for being a phenomenal TA this semester- he and his section are a big reason for why I&#39;ve done as well as I have.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Later in the week when I&#39;m down to the harder problems, I meet up with friends. We work\u00a0<strong>together</strong>. None of that &#34;hey can you show me how you did this&#34; BS. Get up, pick up a whiteboard marker or whatever and help your friends put together a solution. Stay with them while they&#39;re brainstorming stuff. Don&#39;t be that kid who spaces out for 20 minutes and then asks someone to explain something from the beginning. Chip in when you can. If you see a problem in your friends&#39; solution, tear them apart for it. If you think of something that will help push your group towards a solution, mention it. You should be going back and forth for an hour\u00a0on some problems. Even if it doesn&#39;t get you any closer to a solution, you&#39;re still &#34;exercising&#34; the CS 70 muscles in your head and it&#39;ll be helpful later on.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Good luck.</p>\n<p></p>"}, {"anon": "stud", "subject": "", "created": "2017-04-30T19:39:57Z", "content": "<p>&#43;1</p>"}, {"anon": "stud", "subject": "", "created": "2017-04-30T19:39:05Z", "content": "<p></p>"}, {"anon": "stud", "subject": "", "created": "2017-04-30T19:38:16Z", "content": "<p>&#43;1</p>"}], "type": "s_answer", "tag_endorse_arr": ["idkkuk3zhbm6aw", "is6p82e9wlk6li", "itek8117ve07gl", "is6p8z72291ay", "idrikwpr31m46c"], "config": {}, "is_tag_endorse": false}, {"anon": "stud", "folders": [], "data": {"embed_links": null}, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>Still unresolved</p>", "created": "2017-04-30T19:40:09Z", "bucket_order": 30, "bucket_name": "Week 4/30 - 5/6", "type": "followup", "children": [], "no_answer": 0, "id": "j253osul9sc6vi", "updated": "2017-04-30T19:40:09Z", "config": {}}, {"anon": "stud", "folders": [], "data": {"embed_links": null}, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>Being in the class this semester, I can assure you that simply reading notes is not really enough (it gives you a false impression that the topic only goes that deep when in fact you&#39;ll explore it at a much more rich level in discussion/homework).

The following strategy is the basic one that works: (In order)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Ahead of lecture:\u00a0PRINT OUT THE NOTES. Read them and use a pencil to make marks on the notes. Put question marks where you don&#39;t understand or are confused. Write questions in the margins. If you are understanding, try to work out the examples and proofs on a separate piece of paper after reading them. Don&#39;t copy, but just reconstruct after reading. But it&#39;s ok if you don&#39;t understand something. This is still before lecture after all.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>ATTEND LECTURE AND PAY ATTENTION: ask questions about the things that you don&#39;t understand. Take notes using pencil and paper in a notebook or on a pad.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>After lecture: go back and look at the notes again. Are your question marks mostly resolved? If not, spend some time re-reading and thinking about it. If they are still questions, you really need to bring these questions with you to discussion section.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>PRINT OUT THE HOMEWORK. Look over the homework and ask yourself if you can do each problem or at least know how to start. If possible, start in on the easier problems at least. Make marks on the homework printout to indicate your thoughts.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>ATTEND DISCUSSION SECTION AND PARTICIPATE. At appropriate opportunities, ask about the questions you still have regarding the notes.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If you have access to the online problems, do them. Make sure you understand the very basics. If you get stuck somewhere, go back to the notes and read them. If you are encountering a difficulty that you can&#39;t overcome, bring this to your study group later.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Really attempt to do the homework on your own. Spend about 3 hours solo. Try each problem, but if you get stuck, concentrate on writing out potential approaches that you could try, even if you are not sure they will work. Try to formulate the problem mathematically and take some steps if it is not already formulated in that way. If it is formulated in that way, take some steps without worrying about whether these are getting you to the answer just yet. You need to explore. Don&#39;t bang your head against the wall for more than 15 minutes on any one problem or problem part without moving on. It is important not to have any distractions: this means, no texting, no Facebook, no videos playing, etc... Just concentrate on the homework.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Meet up with your study group for another two hours for the first group attack. Explain to them where you are stuck. If you are actually not stuck, but just ran out of your 3 hours, then it is fine to work solo side by side for a while. Ask them for their thoughts about the problems. Share your approaches and listen to them. This is the point at which you can also teach each other the concepts and techniques that they have questions about. Brainstorm angles of attack for a problem. Then sit and try to do them on your own for a bit. Then return to a group dynamic. Set a 30 min limit for banging your head on any particular problem or problem part in one go. \u00a0Explain the relevant parts of the notes to each other as you teach each other. It&#39;s alright to joke around with each other, but don&#39;t use electronic distractions when studying as a group.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Attend HW Party and continue the study group dynamic above, except now, you can also ask TAs and tutors for advice. Between HW Party and a second study group session, you should aim to have sketches of solution strategies for every problem.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Go back and write up all the solutions on your own. (Again, no distractions. Although in this phase, if you want to take a short break after finishing a question, go ahead.) Ideally, you would write the solutions to the problems without any reference to your notes from the study groups --- that is, you would rederive them based on your improved understanding. If you get stuck, consult your notes. Then start on a fresh piece of paper without your notes again for that problem. In general, spending 12 hours per homework total on average (during regular Fall or Spring) is a reasonable amount. With bursts that go higher if something is more challenging for you.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Come up with your own problems and share them with your study group. Variations on existing problems is fine. Ask yourself if you can come up with problems that exercise specific concepts. If you can&#39;t come up with a problem or a variation on a problem, you probably don&#39;t understand the material as well as you need to.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>When the solutions come out, read them carefully. Once again, printing them out is probably a good idea. Understand the way that the solution approached the problem, even if your approach was different and also correct. After you read the solutions, look over your own approach. Did you actually get it right? To what extent? If you got it wrong, redo the problem without reference to the solution. If you can&#39;t do it without looking at the solution, you clearly have a gap in your understanding that needs filling. You need to read the solutions before starting the next homework set. Don&#39;t put this off even if the course doesn&#39;t force it.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The research on education is clear: taking notes on paper/pencil is superior to typing. Having the ability to spread notes out spatially on a desk or the floor allows you to keep more context in your visual field --- that isn&#39;t possible unless you have multiple tablets even with a tablet-based system.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Remember, every single thing in the lower division is something that you need to master.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>"}, {"anon": "no", "uid": "hyq0c18svsu7ek", "subject": "", "created": "2017-05-04T17:28:51Z", "content": "<p>I&#39;d be curious to hear the instructor&#39;s perspective <strong attention=\"giw1lvgzQSy\">&#64;Satish Rao</strong>\u00a0 <strong attention=\"gxj8rtteeuaa9\">&#64;Anant Sahai</strong> \u00a0</p>"}], "type": "i_answer", "tag_endorse_arr": ["inzb7blkbzr56q", "hkkhvv2dy9f4kl", "iy1wju20nkf12p", "ijj65y73ymb5i", "hccnzx9ezt97j7"], "config": {}, "is_tag_endorse": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["idkkuk3zhbm6aw", "ijkkx4org9v4gn", "is25wwpv21b3nn", "iy1wju20nkf12p", "ipn7qodc4jg30x", "ijj65y73ymb5i"], "no_answer": 0, "id": "j23z3k8l323r9", "config": {}, "status": "active", "upvote_ids": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "bookmarked": 18, "num_favorites": 12, "my_favorite": false, "is_bookmarked": true, "is_tag_good": true, "q_edits": [], "i_edits": [], "s_edits": [], "t": 1509626150849, "default_anonymity": "no"}

I am currently agonizing over whether or not to just take the two remaining pre-requsites to know if I can get into the major sooner, or if I am better off with the safer option of spreading out the two pre-requisites over the next two semesters.

However, I have also heard that cs61b with cs70 is the much more manageable option than cs61c and that ee16b is much better taken right after 16a as the topics are very important and that I might forget some of them if I put a semester in between. Also, taking ee16a earlier than cs70 would be a waste of units if I end up not getting into the major.

But although that bug has been fixed in the requirements, students who are in the position of having those be the requirements when they declared will be allowed to complete under those requirements. However, we encourage those students to actually take EE16B since that makes much more sense from an educational point of view. (i.e. It is important for someone who is planning to have a multi-decade career involving CS to know the basics of control theory, the SVD and PCA, and to understand the basics of the dynamic behavior of systems and circuits. The future is going to involve robotics and learning and information-processing by dynamic systems --- if not in the next decade, almost certainly by the decade after that.

The entire treatment of material, style of homeworks, etc. is designed to allow students who take it seriously to sincerely engage with conceptual and skill gaps that they have and to overcome them on this journey. This is simply not one of the design objectives for Math 54.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>EE16A takes it for granted that students live in a world that has computers in it and that software tools should be used to help students connect with the ideas. Practically every week, there is something that forces you to connect with ideas in the course using a computer. \u00a0This facilitates\u00a0students being able to leverage their computational intuition to help strengthen their mathematical intuition.\u00a0This is not something that Math 54 cares about at all and so is a major lost learning opportunity, especially for a student interested in CS.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>EE16A has labs in which you get to see the linear-algebraic concepts that you are learning actually pay off in an application. This allows students to connect physical intuition to further strengthen and reinforce their mathematical intuition. Math 54 has no labs and does not usually try to engage strongly with physical intuition or vice-versa, use mathematical intuition to build physical intuition.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>EE16A is part of a two semester sequence with EE16B --- so it knows that students will get more deeply familiar with ideas as they are developed and encountered over these two semesters. Consequently, EE16A can afford to reduce the seeming coverage of certain linear-algebraic material in exchange for actually deepening students core thinking skills. The circuits module in 16A is really about teaching design and problem modeling and decomposition skills, while also providing much deeper groundings for lots of core linear-algebraic and mathematical ways of thinking. \u00a0(While, yes, also teaching students about a complementary perspective on what information processing is and how it engages with the physical world.) Math 54 isn&#39;t able to spend time on building those mental muscles because it has other things that must be covered. \u00a0By the time students finish EE16B, the treatment of the material has gone beyond Math 54 in multiple dimensions.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In the end, you have to remember that certain key faculty members and several of the key TAs who shaped 16A had come directly from having taught 70 before. They had seen exactly the kinds of mental-muscle weaknesses that had caused students to shed tears in 70. (It&#39;s not the material in 70 that is ever the real cause of student difficulty --- it&#39;s almost always thinking.) And 16AB were explicitly designed to strengthen those muscles while also building broader conceptual foundations for machine learning, robotics, circuit design, vision, AI, etc. Math 54 wasn&#39;t designed with any of this in mind. It serves a wide variety of engineering and physical science departments and focuses on teaching a set of material.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Can students go from Math 54 and do well in 70? Sure they can. Lots of people have. Will students who went through 16AB not have to work in 70? Nope! 70 is going to be work because it takes work to learn new material and internalize it, along with leveling up certain ways of thinking as well. \u00a0But the recommended path of 16A, 16B, and then 70 is recommended for a reason.\u00a0</p>", "created": "2017-06-08T07:41:35Z", "bucket_order": 3, "bucket_name": "Yesterday", "type": "feedback", "uid": "gxj8rtteeuaa9", "children": [], "id": "j3o46yaki8l4zr", "d-bucket": "Yesterday", "updated": "2017-06-08T07:41:35Z", "config": {}}], "no_answer": 0, "id": "j3melmuic9x21v", "updated": "2017-06-07T02:57:24Z", "config": {}}], "tag_good_arr": ["is6p9iqhcexqe", "idtav2lqw5i5m5"], "no_answer": 0, "id": "j3957eojq3h6e3", "config": {}, "status": "active", "upvote_ids": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "bookmarked": 11, "num_favorites": 4, "my_favorite": false, "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "q_edits": [], "i_edits": [], "s_edits": [], "t": 1509626160485, "default_anonymity": "no"}

Third, it creates opportunities for you to propagate bad form and cement\u00a0distortions that arise from conceptual gaps --- this is because instead of learning the concepts, skills, and ways of thinking that we are teaching you, it is possible to simply learn how to do these particular problems. Because you have no guidance or study group or any other resource that is normal during the semester, there is nothing to stop this. Then, when you experience the course itself, this half-bad understanding will actually seem to carry you through. It is far better for you to actually experience challenge that points out what you don&#39;t understand so that you can actually understand.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>So, what should you do if you want to be proactive and prepare ahead of taking a course? First, make sure you have the prereqs. That should go without saying. After that, try your hand at material that exercises the same basic underlying skills but is fundamentally different. For 70, that would be doing things like going through every problem in the textbook by Rosen. Or reading How To Prove It by Vellemen and doing the exercises within that. This will avoid interfering with the ability of the actual course 70 from helping you while still giving you a strong leg up.\u00a0</p>"}], "type": "i_answer", "tag_endorse_arr": ["idriks20rqg42v", "idrikwpr31m46c", "is6p8idxhub7pd", "hc6qtswtj87bi", "is6p8z72291ay", "ijj65y73ymb5i", "ipf2ezhjrt956a", "ijjujonuuj57nk", "irdxxfmolfj6tn", "hzab6kpr3c048h", "is6p71kv5uj5u0", "hktwxo5q8h547h"], "config": {}, "is_tag_endorse": false}], "tag_good_arr": ["hzab6kpr3c048h"], "no_answer": 0, "id": "j3dfubea18tzx", "config": {}, "status": "active", "upvote_ids": [], "request_instructor": 0, "request_instructor_me": false, "bookmarked": 6, "num_favorites": 4, "my_favorite": false, "is_bookmarked": false, "is_tag_good": false, "q_edits": [], "i_edits": [], "s_edits": [], "t": 1509626161254, "default_anonymity": "no"}

Most places have nothing like this for vanilla CS degrees.\u00a0</li><li>More advanced topics in Physics like upper-division courses in classical mechanics as well as statistical mechanics bring in the connection to optimization and minimization principles. Upper-division electromagnetism courses also help one internalize the idea of dropping terms and trying to zoom in on the quantitative essence of a problem. There is a reason that EE16AB have an optimization thread running through them, but as freshmen courses, they cannot exercise the skills involved in aggressively dropping terms and caricaturing problems. (EE105 does that in the context of circuit theory.)</li></ol>\n<p></p>\n<p>So, in the Berkeley context, if you&#39;re interested in AI/ML, remember the core courses from our department: 16A, 16B, 70, 126, 127, 189. Ideally taken in roughly that order. Outside of our department, you definitely should be taking Math 110. It is recommended that you take Physics 7A and 7B as well (there&#39;s a reason they&#39;re required for EECS). Ideally, you would also take upper-division classical mechanics and statistical mechanics, but exposure to other upper-division or graduate courses in EE can also exercise the same mental muscles. And of course, within the department at the upper-div, we have courses like 188, 128, 106AB, as well as graduate courses like 229A that are accessible to well prepared undergrads and extremely helpful for ML/AI type thinking.\u00a0</p>"}], "type": "i_answer", "tag_endorse_arr": ["irs7j4l29v91x6", "is6p9qynt5gz9", "itek8117ve07gl", "is25wwpv21b3nn", "hzd1mbl3gnm3vc", "is6p8brfrzt7az", "is6p9d0f5p6m3", "hccnzx9ezt97j7", "is6p9p92g2nxg", "icguxwqmsgc1ic", "is6p6uis14y5ot", "ipxjx49hzgs1di", "icguy7g0roh1q3", "ijly8cfwGjP", "hyw7jbf3qk2160", "is6p73sapuj5vp", "hktwxo5q8h547h"], "config": {}, "is_tag_endorse": true}, {"anon": "stud", "folders": [], "data": {"embed_links": null}, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>Thank you so much!

Basically, 189 goes further and has less review in it.

Full stop. Then, if you feel very comfortable with the linear algebra and have absorbed the basic optimization problem modeling ideas\u00a0from 16AB, you can in principle take 189. You&#39;d be better off having taken 127 (which by the way is filled with lots of machine learning applications) as well, but you will still get a lot out of 189 and not be lost.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If for whatever reason you have not taken 16AB, then definitely take 127 first. Then, you can take 189 if you feel that your probability intuition is strong. (Not sure how it would actually get strong without having had 126, but maybe you took some other set of courses that really strengthened your probability intuition.) If your probability intuition is weak, then there are going to be parts of 189 where you will basically get slammed and there will be aspects of the story that you won&#39;t be able to properly internalize.

After that, if you&#39;ve taken 16AB, 126 probably is more important than 127 as a foundation, but 127 has way more machine learning in it.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If you can only choose two of the three to take, the answer is unambiguously to take 126 and 127. With those solidly under your belt, you can essentially self-study 189 if you need to. The reverse is not possible. There&#39;s a way of thinking that 126 and 127 convey that is very hard to get without taking the course. Meanwhile, the way of thinking that 189 teaches that goes beyond 126/127 is largely obtainable by the world teaching you.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>To use a machine learning perspective, if your prior is initialized properly by 126 and 127, then stochastic gradient descent by doing real world problems and reading papers will make your inner understanding converge to what 189 is trying to teach you. But if you don&#39;t have 126 and 127, you will very likely get stuck in a bad local minimum.

This continues to hold as long as you have taken 16AB and do not have have some weakness in vector calculus or linear algebra. Being able to reason probabilistically and have intuition about it is very important. 70 is not really enough.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>2) If you have weakness in linear algebra or vector calculus or have not taken 16AB, then 127 is the most important course to prepare for 189. You will experience significant difficulties without that understanding.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>3) If you have taken 16AB and 127, for many students, taking 110 could become largely redundant. A student in that position should take the 110 textbook and read it on their own. See if you need more.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Of course, hopefully everyone understands that both 126 and 127 are *more* fundamental courses to take than 189 if you are interested in machine learning. And if you have to pick only one of the three courses: 126, 127, and 189; then 127 is clearly the most important\u00a0one to take for students regardless of their area. There are lots of machine learning applications\u00a0in 127.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In light of this, the most reasonable course of action is for interested students to take both 126 and 127 before 189. And if because of time pressure to graduate they want to take one concurrently with 189, that course is likely 189. (Although it is better understood as taking 189 concurrently with 127.)\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Courses are far more rewarding if you can really understand what is going on. None of these courses are gratuitously difficult or anything like that, but truly engaging with the material does require hard work and building up your understanding.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I understand that the fashionable name and interesting subject matter\u00a0of 189 is appealing, but when you&#39;re seven weeks into the course, trust me, no amount of fashionability is going to help you out or even make you feel any better.

In that way, ML is at the intersection of control and signal processing, with an underlying connection to information theory and statistics. I would want my students to understand the fundamentals here, including the core tradeoffs. I also want them to understand how the optimization paradigm applies to this domain because this helps\u00a0gain some understanding of informational vs computational limits. The different ML techniques and approaches are vehicles for conveying an understanding of how to think better, not some grab-bag of tools.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In my ideal world, I would teach 189 to students who have already taken both 126 and 127 (so that I could concentrate on the ML aspects as opposed to probability and optimization aspects bottlenecking student understanding), as well as of course the full EECS lower division. But that would be too radical of a change from precedent and policy. However, following department policy, I am going to freely assume and rely on a mastery of the EECS lower division, where because of the nature of the material this is going to fall most specifically on 16AB and 70 as well as Math 53. I am also going to assume maturity corresponding to the nature of the course --- 189 is not like 126, 127, and 170 which are meant to be taken among the first set of upper-division courses. 189 is meant to be taken with more maturity.

After that, there is the whole circuits perspective on information processing which shows up in the neural nets parts of 189 --- which are basically circuits that do information processing.

In the lower-division, it is Math 53, EE16A, EE16B, and CS70. In the upper-division, it is EECS 126 (clearly indicated over Stat 140 or 134 for students that have had 70), 127, and 189. To this, one should almost certainly add 170 and 188. At the undergrad level, this should be rounded out by 106AB in upper division for robotics. (And probably 120 because it is such a common language that you will find others relying on it later.)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But if you really want to pursue this area, then you probably need to go to graduate school. This adds another set of courses and considerations. First, you really want to deepen your mathematical training. For this, the courses Math 110 and 104 are probably essential. You&#39;ll definitely take more Math/Stat in graduate school. So probably taking Math 113 is a good idea for Math breadth, because you might not end up taking it later in graduate school.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The other key to your undergrad training is the selective taking of foundational graduate courses in EECS. The best choices are probably among EE223 (when it is offered --- really hard to beat this in terms of foundations), EE229A (information theory), EE227B or 227C (more optimization beyond 127). You don&#39;t have to take all of these by any means --- one to two is fine. This is assuming that you are doing undergrad research in the typical way, which means that you are probably learning about more applied things directly. If you want to add in one of the relevant graduate special topics courses that are offered in the learning space (e.g. Deep X), then do it. But really, the cutting edge of the field will keep evolving and so taking the special topics courses when you are a graduate student is probably a better bet. The only reason to take them earlier (while an undergrad here) is that you will probably have to go elsewhere for graduate school. The foundational grad courses in Stat Learning like 281AB can arguably wait for grad school itself since you&#39;re likely to take them then.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The above is a core AI/ML oriented perspective. If you want to add a different tightly synergistic dimension, high performance systems (162, 267, Math 128x) is one nice choice. Another is formal methods (144, 164, 172, etc.). Another is deepening your exposure to control (128, 221A, 222, etc.).

Think of it this way: If you are interested in AI/ML because you want to build learning algorithms or intelligent agents, then perhaps it&#39;s not as important to you. I think you could get by with knowledge of optimization and probability. On the other hand, if you are interested in foundational questions (such as: is it even possible to learn? what is the nature of a good statistical estimator? what is the behavior of common estimators asymptotically?) then you&#39;ll probably want to take more statistics courses. The former is about ML as a part of AI; the latter is about ML as a part of statistical inference.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I don&#39;t think Math 128A is very valuable.

As contradictory as this sounds, I think you should try to prioritize both a strong foundation and depth. Foundation meaning courses like Math 104. While you&#39;re taking Math 104 you may not see why it is important or useful, but you don&#39;t want to go into graduate courses feeling shaky about fundamental math concepts. Undergraduate is your time to build these fundamentals anyway. By depth I mean figuring out a more specific interest (e.g. spectral graph theory) and then learning more about it. For a topic as specific as that, you probably won&#39;t find much besides special topics courses and maybe one introductory graduate course, so you might need to pick up some books for outside reading.</p>\n<p>It might seem like I&#39;m saying you should do everything, so to make it clearer, I don&#39;t recommend that you take a lot of non-foundational undergraduate courses. For example I wouldn&#39;t recommend that you take (this is just a crazy example) EE 105, 106A/B, 113, 117, 120, 121, 130, 134, and then CS 169, 172, 186, ...

If you really want to get into these areas, you are going to go to graduate school. This means that you will have plenty of opportunities to take courses then as well. So the question becomes, what do you take now vs what do you take later? This perspective informed my answer. Statistics foundations are something that you certainly have to build at some point (to have a well-rounded education in this space), so the question is when. I believe that there are good reasons that those foundations are better built when you are a graduate student. While the ones that I listed were more important to prioritize as an undergraduate. A part of the reason is that foundational breadth also impacts your choice of potential advisers and projects as you begin graduate school. Not having Stat 135 almost certainly closes no doors. Not having 126 or 127 can definitely close doors (to take an extreme example). There is often a qualitative difference between the first couple of things that you do as a PhD student and the last couple of things. What is good to take early are things that are qualitatively maturity-enhancing, broadly useful skill-granting, and/or mind-expanding.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>", "created": "2017-07-04T05:25:04Z", "bucket_order": 22, "bucket_name": "Week 7/2 - 7/8", "type": "feedback", "uid": "gxj8rtteeuaa9", "children": [], "id": "j4p4riw2fbn7nl", "updated": "2017-07-04T05:25:04Z", "config": {}}, {"anon": "no", "folders": [], "data": {"embed_links": null}, "subject": "<p>I also don&#39;t think Math 128A was that valuable, except maybe the numerical linear algebra section (chapter 6).\u00a0Math 104 I found was good for building my mathematical maturity, but not sure what it&#39;s used for other than in the definitions of statistical estimators (and also CLT definitions and related use real analysis language I guess).

(And I say this as someone who is not in CS systems.)\u00a0From a distance, what is happening is that CS systems is becoming exactly like what EE circuits has been like for a while --- the details of the algorithms and problems matter because there are incredible synergies to the implementation and algorithms need to be changed to be implementable. This means that a CS systems person needs to be educated in the mold of a traditional EE circuits education --- and that means getting a healthy dose of mathy courses to go alongside a core set of CS systems courses.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Fortunately,\u00a0the lower-division core that everyone takes has already been shifted in anticipation of this. All CS Systems students need to take Math 53, EE16A, EE16B, and 70 along with 61A, 61B, and 61C. This goes without saying. From there, it is about choosing courses that are both core as well some that go deep into their area. Of course 162 is an amazing course that is core and central to CS systems. A CS Systems student should take other 16X courses as well for depth in systems. 149 is another core course for the emerging area of CS systems in embedded systems --- since being tied to servers and PCs is way too limiting an education for the future.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But beyond that, a CS Systems student should take core courses elsewhere as well. The core upper-div algorithms course is 170, and all CS systems students should take that. The core upper-div ML course is 127, and I personally think that all CS systems students should take that too (because it is the *optimization* part of ML that the systems person has to support in their system design, as well as the *optimization* aspect of ML that a systems person is going to be leveraging to make their systems work better.). The core upper-div digital design course is 151, and arguably, a CS systems student should take that or 152. You need to be a able to understand FPGAs. You can rent FPGAs on AWS now. This isn&#39;t something esoteric as a compute platform.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>So should a CS systems person take 189? Should they take 126? There is no way that either of these courses can compete with 127 for a CS system person&#39;s love (and I say this as someone who has taught both 126 and 189). They&#39;re great courses, but not as important. It is all about opportunity costs. Put 126 up head-to-head against say 164.... It is hard to say that 126 wins for a CS Systems person. So 189 clearly loses that competition.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>So, sure, if a CS Systems oriented person has taken a solid foundation (including 127) and has gone into depth in CS Systems, then they can take further courses as per their interest. If that means taking 189, go for it. Presumably, that person enjoyed 127 and wanted to go further. To learn more about this particular application area for systems that lean heavily on optimization and data.\u00a0</p>"}], "type": "i_answer", "tag_endorse_arr": ["idgol3r3v9d4yk", "is6p9v8jj8x141", "is6p9ii2njqq5", "idgok7uwjr34az", "hzd1l6l72xn2pt", "is6p73sapuj5vp", "j52tuayf2uf7om", "hccnzx9ezt97j7", "ijyjogkb8he529", "icguxxp4omy1ix", "ijkkwecxsj63n8", "ipkfr46v4g91se", "hzd1lhoceif2yh", "hzt74ba6hds1qp", "hyw7jbf3qk2160", "is6p8zl3nphb8", "is6p74auhrg5w3", "hzd1nm9ystr6tv", "h32s1v796dn5lq", "hxsegbyiots7au", "is6p9vbn8l145", "hktwxo5q8h547h"], "config": {}, "is_tag_endorse": false}, {"anon": "stud", "folders": [], "data": {"embed_links": null}, "no_upvotes": 0, "subject": "<p>Is CS 162 good for learning about distributed systems/cloud computing?
